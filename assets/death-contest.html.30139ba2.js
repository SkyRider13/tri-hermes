His direct order was a clear sign that he was uncharacteristically nervous, betraying his usual calm demeanor, which meant that this case was different than usual.</p><p>I stood up from my desk and started packing up my equipment.</p><p>\u2014What are the details, Sergeant Mito?</p><p>\u2014You will see once you get there\u2013 He started replying, when suddenly his phone began to ring\u2013 Sorry, I\u2019m a bit busy right now, I\u2019ll be expecting your report.</p><p>Mito picked up the call and walked away from Forensics without giving me time to react. Having finished our short exchange, I finished packing my things and exited the station to get into my car to go to the Rennes Building.</p><p>The Rennes Building is a large corporate building housing the headquarters of the Japanese branch of the Rennes Corporation, a large international company of French origin which produces and distributes tobacco and different types of cigarettes. During the last three years this branch had grown in profits quite a bit, and it was said that the founder of the company, Jacques Pierre Rennes, would host an event inside that building in a few days to congratulate the branch.</p><p>\u2014(This may be the reason why Sergeant Mito was so nervous, maybe it involves one of the big shots at the company\u2026) \u2013I thought while driving.</p><p>Once I reached my destination, despite being so early in the morning, I was greeted by a large group of bystanders and reporters surrounding the building, with some police officers preventing them from getting close to it. I made my way past them and showed my identification to one of the officers, who let me pass through.</p><p>\u2014Where is it? \u2013I asked, trying to lower my voice to not alert the public.</p><p>\u2014It\u2019s inside the building, in the entrance hall.</p><p>Putting on my gloves, I walked towards the front door and made my way inside the enormous building.</p><p>The hall was large and spacious, with stairs at both sides and a row of elevators behind. It was filled to the brim with works of art, from paintings to sculptures of all kinds, and a large red sign saying \u201CCONGRATULATIONS!\u201D was hung above. Both it and most of the paintings were suspended with steel wires, probably with hooks at the tips which remained obscured behind what they were holding.</p><p>\u2014(I guess today was meant to be the big day, huh\u2026)</p><p>Leaving the open door behind me, I started to enter deeper into the hall. I was greeted by a reception desk with two empty chairs, next to which stood an officer, talking to a man. The latter was severely older than the officer and, judging by his uniform, he must have been one of the building\u2019s janitors. I approached them.</p><p>\u2014Sakuragawa, from Forensics. What is the situation?</p><p>The janitor stood looking at the floor, silent, while the officer turned towards me. He was a young man in his 30s with short dark hair and an amicable face. Despite being slightly older than me, his uniform showed that his status on the hierarchy was quite low.</p><p>\u2014My name is Joba Kawachi, from the nearby police box. \u2013He replied politely\u2013 I was the first one to arrive at the scene and call for backup. This man right here discovered the body half an hour ago, and immediately called the police.</p><p>\u2014Thank you, officer Kawachi. Could you lead me to the body? I have to examine the scene.</p><p>\u2014Of course, it\u2019s further inside the hall \u2013He started walking, but not before directing his attention to the janitor and speaking to him in a calm voice. Sir, you should stay here and don\u2019t move, okay?</p><p>\u2014Yes, officer\u2026</p><p>The old janitor replied with a low voice and a defeated expression, still under the influence of what he had previously set his eyes on. It would take a long time for him to forget about this, if ever. Not just anyone can stand being close to a corpse, let alone examining it, which was what my job was for.</p><p>\u2014By the way, the janitor was not the first person to find the body. He also found another man, a foreigner, unconscious close to it. An ambulance picked him up shortly before you arrived.</p><p>While following Kawachi down the hall, I started looking at the different works of art spread around the room, when I noticed a particular chalice sitting on top of a pedestal in the center of the entrance hall. It was seemingly carved on white rock, and featured Egyptian motifs on its surface. Noticing my curiosity, Kawachi started giving an explanation.</p><p>\u2014I heard the founder of the company brought some artifacts from his personal collection here. That chalice must be a replica, because I remember seeing a very similar one on a documentary a while ago.</p><p>\u2014A friend of mine would love seeing this under different circumstances, he\u2019s a bit of a history fan.</p><p>As we finished our little exchange, we continued walking towards the end of the hall. From my position I could see a large statue, as well as the cables supporting the final painting hung at the end of the room. Once we passed the statue, I slowed my pace.</p><p>It was there.</p><p>Suspended from the cables was not a painting, but the bloated and mangled remains of a man. His arms had been twisted several times in an unnatural position behind his back, with the hooks which were meant to support a painting piercing his wrists. The skin on shoulders and forearms had been ruptured, hanging tattered as macabre feathers. All of his body seemed to have been inflated, leaving him almost unrecognisable as a man were it not for his still visible beard, which appeared to have once been blond, now tainted of the red oozing from all his orifices, including his eye sockets, empty voids without eyes, which dripped on a pool of blood under him.</p><p>I readied my camera and made a signal to Kawachi so he would stay back while I took wide shots of the scene. Now I understood why sergeant Mito was so worried about back at the station.</p><p>\u2014Messed up, right? I don\u2019t know who possibly could have done something like this. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll stay away from it, gives me the creeps.</p><p>\u2014Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take it from here \u2013I said, trying to calm him down and, in a way, myself too.</p><p>Camera still in hand, I got closer to the body to take pictures of smaller details, when I noticed an object on the floor, right next to the pool of blood. It was a wallet, stained in red. I quickly marked its location and took a picture of its original position, after which I picked it up and opened it to see the ID.</p><p>\u2014(Salvador Pallars... Another foreigner. Judging by the beard and hair colour, it must be the victim\u2019s wallet which fell off at some point. The blood on it seems to not have dried long ago.)</p><p>While I was storing the wallet as evidence, my phone vibrated. It was a message from my superior, telling me an Investigator would be there in ten minutes. I sent a quick reply, my mind completely focused on analysing the scene.</p><p>Behind the body was a painting, supporting itself next to the back wall. It must have been what was supposed to be hanging from those cables, but a large stain of blood hid what it might have depicted. Most likely it was from the victim, but just in case I took a picture of the painting before taking a sample of the blood to have it analysed back at the lab.</p><p>With nothing else surrounding the body, I moved my attention to it. Being careful to not damage it, I started taking pictures of its different injuries from up close, starting from the bottom and moving upwards. His left hand had a red tattoo of abstract shape, which stood out from the rest of his skin which, while damaged, did not show any sort of decorative markings. Taking a closer look at his hands also made me realise that it wasn\u2019t just his orifices that were bleeding, but also the tips of his fingers, right under the nails, which dripped down as the body swayed slightly\u2013 Wait, bleeding and swaying?</p><p>I suddenly had a dreadful realisation, and quickly moved my fingers to the mass that used to be his neck\u2026 And I sensed something. It was extremely faint, but I was able to pick up on a pulse. Rapidly, I looked behind me in the direction Kawachi was standing.</p><p>\u2014Call an ambulance, fast! He\u2019s still alive!</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u2026</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The ambulance arrived shortly after. With a lot of care, the paramedics unhooked the man and took him away. I tried looking for fingerprints on the statue or the painting, but none were found on the former and only one type in the latter. The janitor told me that yesterday the building had been closed, and he and the rest of the crew had cleaned up the whole building to prepare for the celebration today. However, I managed to get some fingerprints from the front door. They were from the victim, the unconscious man, the janitor, officer Kawachi and a pair of unidentified ones.</p><p>I heard he died on his way to the hospital. Strangely, the hand tattoo was nowhere to be found when his corpse was examined. Despite my report and the subsequent investigation, we never found out what happened to him.</p><h2 id="aareez-always-with-you" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#aareez-always-with-you" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Aareez - Always With You</h2><p>She\u2019d always thought their lives would go out in a hurricane, a fire. In fury. Something wild, something like the unbelievable experiences he loved talking about so much, straight out of the books she loved reading so much.</p><p>But there was no fire here. No storm. Only the sterile, suffocating quiet of the hospital room. Only the steady, artificial beeping of the monitors. Only the shallow rise and fall of his chest, too slow, too fragile.</p><p>It was raining again.</p><p>Not the kind of stormy downpour that rattled windows and soaked the earth in thunder. No, this rain was softer - gentler. A whisper of grief, like the sky itself was mourning. The clouds outside cast a dim, blue-gray light through the hospital window, and everything inside felt... muted. Still. Like the world was holding its breath.</p><p>Al was dying.</p><p>And for all the years he spent defying impossible odds, surviving experiences no one else could dream of - he couldn\u2019t outrun this. Not this time. It wasn\u2019t some wilderness he could fight his way out of, wasn\u2019t a wound he could tape over or a challenge he could overcome with sheer will.</p><p>It was sickness. Something silent and creeping, that stole pieces of him day by day, for months now.</p><p>And now, all that remained was this room. These last few breaths. This final goodbye.</p><p>Elia sat beside the bed, her hand wrapped tightly around his. She hadn\u2019t let go in hours. Her fingers trembled with every heartbeat.</p><p>&quot;Al...&quot; she whispered, voice breaking, &quot;Please. Just hold on a little longer. Just a little longer, okay? They - they\u2019re working on a new treatment, they said it might-&quot;</p><p>\u201CElly,\u201D Alius said, and even though his voice was barely audible, it still carried that warmth. That same steady gentleness she\u2019d fallen in love with all those years ago. \u201CHey\u2026 it\u2019s okay.\u201D</p><p>It wasn\u2019t. Nothing about this was okay.</p><p>His skin was pale, drawn tight over fragile bones. The fever had stripped the color from his cheeks, and the spark in his eyes - his fire, his unshakable light - had dimmed to embers. Every breath came with effort now, shallow and raspy, as though even the air didn\u2019t want to burden him.</p><p>He squeezed her hand weakly, as if to say <em>I\u2019m still here.</em></p><p>But for how long?</p><p>\u201CI wanted more time,\u201D she said, biting back a sob, \u201CWe - we were supposed to grow old together. We <em>deserved</em> forever. I thought we had forever.\u201D</p><p>Al smiled - How could he still smile? - faintly. \u201CWe did. In our own way.\u201D</p><p>Tears fell freely down her cheeks. \u201CThat\u2019s not fair. That\u2019s not enough.\u201D</p><p>Outside the room, his mother sat in the dimly lit hallway, hands clasped tightly in her lap. She barely moved, barely breathed. The years had touched her gently, but grief - grief had worn her down like the tide against stone, relentless and unyielding. She had lost her husband years ago, had learned to live with that hollow ache. But this\u2026 this was different. She was about to lose her son.</p><p>Her baby boy.</p><p>Beside her, Naim, Alius\u2019s best friend, leaned forward, elbows on his knees, fingers laced together. His shoulders were hunched in a way that made him look older than he was. Ide sat silently across from them, staring at the ground, refusing to cry - because if she started, she might never stop.</p><p>And further down the hall, Alius\u2019 sister Adera kept watch over a ten year old girl with bright chestnut brown hair like her mother and wide, tear-filled brown eyes like her father.</p><p>Sellia had begged to go in. Pleaded. Screamed.</p><p>But Elia couldn\u2019t bear it. No one could.</p><p>They couldn\u2019t let her see her father like this.</p><p>Not when her last memory could still be him smiling, albeit weakly, holding his head up high, laughing like the world, <em>their world</em> , wasn\u2019t falling apart.</p><p>Back in the room, Elia pressed her forehead against the edge of the bed.</p><p>\u201CI can\u2019t do this without you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou won\u2019t have to,\u201D Alius whispered, and Elia could hear the lie in his voice, could feel the tremble in his hand beneath hers. \u201CYou\u2019re stronger than you think. You always have been.\u201D</p><p>\u201CDon\u2019t say goodbye,\u201D she said, squeezing his hand so tightly her knuckles went white. \u201CPlease don\u2019t say goodbye.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m not,\u201D he murmured. \u201CI\u2019m just saying\u2026 thank you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor what?\u201D</p><p>\u201CFor loving me. For giving me Sellia. For making me believe in forever.\u201D</p><p>A sob tore through her chest. \u201CYou promised me a lifetime.\u201D</p><p>She was being selfish. Disgusting. She couldn\u2019t find it in herself to care.</p><p>\u201CI gave you everything I had,\u201D he said, and his eyes fluttered closed for a moment - just a moment - but her heart seized all the same.</p><p>She shook him gently. \u201CAl. Al - stay with me, okay? Please - just stay.\u201D</p><p>He opened his eyes again, barely. His voice was more strained. \u201CI\u2019m tired, Elly\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know,\u201D she whispered, brushing the damp hair from his forehead, \u201CI know, but just a little longer. Please. Just a little.\u201D</p><p>His breathing grew shallower.</p><p>Each second was a countdown now.</p><p>Elia\u2019s whole world was collapsing in on itself - because Al wasn\u2019t just her husband, or the father of her child. He was her beginning. Her always. Her every heartbeat.</p><p>And he was slipping away.</p><p>\u201CI wanted to stay till I see Sellia\u2019s future,\u201D Alius said weakly. A tear rolled down his pale skin as he let out a gasp. \u201CWanted to walk her down the aisle someday\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CShe still needs you,\u201D Elia whispered, choking on her grief. \u201C<em>I</em> still need you.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI know,\u201D he said. \u201CAnd I\u2019ll still be there.

I want you. <em>I want you here.</em> \u201D</p><p>His smile remained, but a soft frown emerged on his brow. She fought the urge to smooth it out, to kiss him until all he knew was her lips on him.</p><p>\u201CElly\u2026 can I\u2026 ask you something?\u201D</p><p>Elia breathed. \u201CAnything.\u201D</p><p>Alius, for the first time that day, moved to sit up.

He compromised by staring her in the eye.</p><p>\u201CPromise me,\u201D he murmured. \u201CYou\u2019ll be okay. Please promise me you\u2019ll-\u201D a cough. \u201CYou\u2019ll take care of Sellia? You won\u2019t give up?\u201D</p><p>Elia\u2019s eyes burnt as she lowered her head to his hand. She hated this. She wanted it all to end. \u201CAl\u2026\u201D</p><p>\u201CPlease?\u201D he whimpered, his voice breaking, and she thought that maybe she broke with it, if only she had any sense of what being whole felt like. She had lost that feeling since yesterday morning, when he took a turn for the worst.</p><p>She looked up at her husband. Her everything, staring right back at her with tears glimmering in his eyes, and she knew there was only one possible answer.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019ll never give up,\u201D she kissed his hand. \u201CNot until it\u2019s over, right?\u201D</p><p>He smiled back, content, but there was something wrong with it and Elia couldn\u2019t place what until-</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He was fading. She could feel it.</p><p>\u201CI love you,\u201D he breathed.</p><p>\u201CI love you more,\u201D she said, tears soaking the sheets beneath her.</p><p>His lips curved faintly. \u201CNot possible\u2026\u201D</p><p>She leaned up to kiss his forehead, then his cheek, then his lips. \u201CPlease don\u2019t leave me.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI wish I could stay.\u201D</p><p>He looked past her then, his gaze distant - far away. And she knew.</p><p>\u201CNo. No no no no - Al, <em>look at me.</em> Please. Don\u2019t go. <em>Don\u2019t go.</em> \u201D</p><p>But his eyes were glassy now. His chest barely rose.</p><p>And then silence.</p><p>The monitors began to scream, but Elia didn\u2019t hear them. Didn\u2019t feel the doctors as they pushed in around her. Didn\u2019t move when they pulled her back, tried to revive him, shouted orders, tried <em>everything.</em> But it was too late.</p><p>He was gone.</p><p>She dropped to her knees.</p><p>And the scream that left her throat was one the world would never forget.</p><hr><p>They let her hold him after.</p><p>Once the monitors fell silent, once the chaos faded into quiet murmurs and drawn faces and shaking heads, they let her crawl back to his bedside and cradle him in her arms. He was still warm.</p><p>That made it worse.</p><p>It made her feel like if she just wished hard enough, screamed loud enough, maybe - <em>maybe</em> - his heart would start again. That it wasn\u2019t over. That there was still time.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Time had run out.</p><p>And all Elia could do was hold the love of her life and sob into his hospital gown like a woman who had just lost the air in her lungs, the sky above her, the earth beneath her feet. Because she had.</p><p>&quot;Al\u2026 please,&quot; she whispered, her tears soaking into his skin. &quot;Please\u2026 wake up. Just one more minute. Just one more &#39;I love you.&#39; <em>Please.</em>&quot;</p><p>The world stayed quiet around her.</p><p>She stayed like that for what felt like an eternity. Until she heard a soft knock. A quiet voice.</p><p>\u201CElia?\u201D</p><p>His mother\u2019s eyes were red, and her arms trembled as she stepped into the room. She looked at Alius - her son - then at Elia, and her breath hitched.</p><p>\u201CI didn\u2019t get to say goodbye,\u201D she whispered, as her knees buckled and Elia caught her before she hit the ground.</p><p>They clung to each other, these two women who had loved him more than life, and sobbed into each other\u2019s shoulders. Elia felt her mother-in-law\u2019s hand clutch the fabric of her shirt, felt her whisper Alius\u2019s name over and over like a prayer - like if she kept saying it, he\u2019d answer.</p><p>But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>He never would again.</p><p>They told Sellia the next morning.</p><hr><p>Elia had sent her with Adera, trusting her to take Sellia home as the night stretched on. She barely registered the moment they left. Everything was a blur, her body moving on instinct as she filled out paperwork, her signature shaky but legible. Discussions of payments, logistics - things that should have mattered - felt distant, meaningless.</p><p>Around her, voices murmured condolences, hushed whispers of <em>\u201CI\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201D</em> and <em>\u201CHe was so young\u2026\u201D</em> But the words slid off her, weightless, empty. What did apologies matter when he was gone?</p><p>She arrived home early that morning, exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin. The night had been spent ensuring his mother wouldn\u2019t be alone - Naim had promised to stay with her, to make sure she ate, to keep her from collapsing under the weight of her grief. It was the least Elia could do.</p><p>But now, as she stepped through the door, none of that mattered. Only one thought consumed her. <em>Sellia.</em></p><p>She moved on autopilot, silent as a shadow as she made her way to her daughter\u2019s room. When she opened the door, the dim light of dawn cast soft golden streaks across the bed, illuminating the scene before her.</p><p>Adera was curled protectively around her, her arms wrapped around the girl\u2019s waist, holding her close even in sleep.</p><p>The sight nearly broke Elia all over again.</p><p>She swallowed, stepping inside, the floor creaking beneath her. She knelt beside the bed, reaching out to touch Adera\u2019s shoulder. The younger girl stirred, blinking blearily before her gaze locked onto Elia\u2019s.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. Then, Adera\u2019s face crumpled, eyes glistening. Still, she tried to smile.</p><p>\u201CHi, Elia,\u201D she whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears. \u201CHow are you feeling?\u201D</p><p>Elia couldn\u2019t answer. Her throat was too tight, her emotions too raw. Instead, she cupped Adera\u2019s face gently, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead. Adera let out a trembling sob at the gesture, her hands gripping Elia\u2019s sleeves for just a second before she pulled away.</p><p>Elia turned toward the bed, her gaze settling on her daughter\u2019s sleeping form. Sellia was small, too small, curled into herself like she could keep the world out if she just held tight enough.</p><p>Elia forced herself to speak. \u201CCan I sit with her? Alone?\u201D</p><p>Adera wiped at her tears, nodding. \u201CI\u2019ll be in the living room,\u201D she whispered. \u201CPlease\u2026 call me if you need anything.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI got it.\u201D Elia squeezed her hand. \u201CThank you.\u201D</p><p>And then she was alone.</p><p>Carefully, she eased herself onto the bed, her weight sinking into the mattress as she inched closer to her daughter. The silence stretched, thick and heavy, filled with the unspoken things she didn\u2019t know how to say.</p><p>She barely had time to settle before Sellia jolted awake.</p><p>The girl shot up like a coiled spring, fists clutching the blankets so tightly her knuckles turned white. Her breath was ragged, uneven, like she\u2019d been fighting off the truth even in sleep.</p><p>\u201CMom?\u201D Sellia\u2019s voice was hoarse, the remnants of dried tears rough in her throat. Elia\u2019s heart cracked at the realization - she had cried herself to sleep.</p><p>Elia swallowed down the lump in her throat and opened her arms. \u201CHi, baby.\u201D</p><p>Sellia fell into her embrace immediately, small and trembling, clinging to her like she was the only thing keeping her tethered to this world.</p><p>Then, the question came.</p><p>\u201CWhere\u2019s Dad?\u201D</p><p>Elia froze.</p><p>The breath left her lungs in a sharp, broken gasp. She lifted a trembling hand, brushing Sellia\u2019s hair from her face as gently as she could, willing herself to find the words - <em>the right words .</em></p><p>But nothing came.</p><p>Her mouth opened, but only a fractured sound escaped - a breath, a sob, something broken beyond repair.</p><p>It was enough - Sellia understood.</p><p>Her little face crumpled, her eyes wide with disbelief, with horror, with the kind of pain a child should never have to endure.</p><p>\u201CNo.\u201D</p><p>Elia shook her head, and the moment she did, Sellia screamed.</p><p>A raw, piercing sound, filled with more devastation than her body should have been able to contain.</p><p>\u201CNo! No, no, no - he promised me! He <em>promised</em> me!\u201D</p><p>She thrashed in Elia\u2019s arms, wrenching herself away, pounding her small fists against her mother\u2019s chest, desperate, furious, inconsolable.</p><p>\u201CHe <em>said</em> he\u2019d always come home! He <em>said</em> he\u2019d never leave!\u201D Her cries turned ragged, her fists losing strength, her rage collapsing into agony. \u201CHe promised\u2026\u201D</p><p>Elia couldn\u2019t speak.</p><p>She just wrapped her arms around her daughter, holding her together as she came apart. She pressed frantic, desperate kisses into her hair, rocking her back and forth, whispering nothing but <em>I\u2019m here, I\u2019ve got you, I love you</em> , over and over, like the words could somehow make up for the one person who wasn\u2019t here to say them.</p><p>Sellia clutched at Elia\u2019s shirt, gasping between sobs. \u201CI want to see him,\u201D she whimpered. \u201CPlease. I <em>need</em> to see him.\u201D</p><p>Elia squeezed her eyes shut, pressing her lips to the top of her daughter\u2019s head, trying - failing - to steady her voice.</p><p>\u201CI know, baby,\u201D she whispered. \u201CI know. He wanted to see you, too. But\u2026 we didn\u2019t want you to remember him like that. He didn\u2019t want that, either.\u201D</p><p>Sellia hiccupped, her breath coming in uneven bursts. \u201CBut\u2026 but I <em>don\u2019t care</em> -\u201D</p><p>\u201C<em>He</em> cared,\u201D Elia whispered, voice breaking. \u201CHe wanted you to remember him strong. To remember him as your hero.\u201D</p><p>Sellia looked up at her then, her eyes red, her cheeks damp, her entire world crumbling in front of her.</p><p>She sniffled, swallowing down another sob.</p><p>\u201CCan we bring him back?\u201D she pleaded, voice so small, so desperate, it physically hurt . \u201CPlease? Mom, please - <em>I\u2019ll do anything.\u201D</em></p><p>Ellia couldn\u2019t take it.</p><p>She pulled Sellia back into her arms, holding her so tightly it felt like she\u2019d never let go. She buried her face in her daughter\u2019s hair, her tears slipping silently into the soft strands.</p><p>\u201CI\u2019m sorry,\u201D she whispered, voice raw, wrecked, barely more than a breath.</p><p>Sellia broke all over again.</p><p>And there, in the stillness of the morning, in the hollow emptiness of a world without him, they shattered together.</p><hr><p>The funeral came a week later.</p><p>It was sunny, of course.</p><p><em>Al would have liked that,</em> Elia thought bitterly. Bright and clear and warm, even when it felt like her whole world was drowning in shadows.</p><p>Sellia clung to Elia\u2019s side, a small, solemn figure in a navy dress. She hadn\u2019t spoken all morning. Just stared ahead, her eyes hollow, holding a drawing in her hands that she\u2019d refused to let go of - a picture she\u2019d made last week of their family. All three of them were smiling.</p><p>Naim spoke first. His voice cracked halfway through, and he had to stop and collect himself before finishing. Ide was brave enough to follow, her words clipped and quiet, but every syllable trembled. Everytime one of his friends went up to speak, each as sad as the last, Elia wondered if they knew how happy Alius would have been. That all of his friends were together again, all for <em>him.</em></p><p>Then came his mother.</p><p>She didn\u2019t write a speech. She just stood at the podium, looked at the sky, and said, \u201CHe was my boy. He made me proud every day of his life.\u201D</p><p>And then she cried.</p><p>Elia didn\u2019t think she could stand. But when her name was called, she walked anyway - legs numb, heart screaming - and looked out at the sea of faces. So many people. So many lives he touched.</p><p>\u201CI met Al when I was six,\u201D she said. Her voice shook, but she didn\u2019t stop. \u201CAnd somehow, he was already saving me, just by being kind. That\u2019s who he was. Kind. Infuriating. Stubborn.\u201D</p><p>A soft ripple of laughter.</p><p>She smiled, and it hurt. \u201CHe was everything I needed\u2026 before I even knew I needed it. He was my first love. My only love. The father of our child. My partner. My heart.\u201D</p><p>Her hands gripped the podium.</p><p>\u201CI don\u2019t know how to live without him. Sometimes, I don\u2019t <em>want</em> to. But he told me\u2026 he made me promise\u2026 that I would keep going. That I would take care of Sellia. That I would remember him not like this, but the way he was. Loud. Happy. Relentless.\u201D</p><p>She took a shaky breath.</p><p>\u201CSo I will. For him.\u201D</p><p>Her gaze dropped to the casket.</p><p>\u201CI love you, Al. Always.\u201D</p><p>And then she stepped down.</p><hr><p>That night, Elia couldn\u2019t sleep.</p><p>She lay in their bed - no, <em>her</em> bed now - staring at the empty pillow beside her, wishing for a voice, a hand, anything.</p><p>She turned over.</p><p>Alius\u2019s old hoodie was still folded on the dresser.</p><p>She rose, walked over, and pressed it to her face. It didn\u2019t smell like him anymore. Just fabric and dust and something long gone.</p><p>But it was all she had.</p><p>She curled into it on the bed and cried herself into silence.</p><hr><p>Later, when Sellia woke up screaming from a nightmare, Elia ran to her room, gathering her into her arms.</p><p>\u201CHe was gone,\u201D Sellia sobbed. \u201CHe was right there and he was gone and I couldn\u2019t find him.\u201D</p><p>Elia hugged her tighter. \u201CIt\u2019s okay, baby. It\u2019s okay.\u201D</p><p>\u201CIs he really\u2026 really gone, Mommy?\u201D</p><p>A pause. Then: \u201CYeah, sweetheart. He is.\u201D</p><p>Sellia was silent, before a whisper that was more like a breathless sob escaped her. \u201CWhat if I forget him? What if I forget his voice?\u201D</p><p>\u201CYou won\u2019t,\u201D Elia whispered. \u201CI promise. He\u2019s in your blood, Sellia. He\u2019s in every part of you. And I\u2019ll remind you of him every day.\u201D</p><p>Sellia curled into her chest.</p><p>\u201CI miss him so much.\u201D</p><p>\u201CI do too, baby. More than anything.\u201D</p><p>And they stayed like that until morning.</p><hr><p>Alius had once said he didn\u2019t care about becoming rich as much as he cared about being remembered. About making people smile.</p><p>And he had.</p><p>Elia smiled again, eventually.</p><p>Not because it hurt any less. Not because the grief faded. But because every smile was a way to honor him. To keep him alive, in their hearts, in their stories.</p><p>Sellia kept drawing him. And when she became the greatest, kindest artist in the world? She dedicated it to her father, her hero .</p><p>His mother kept telling stories. Stories of her son, her granddaughter and how <em>similar</em> they are. How brave and kind her daughter-in-law is. She told stories of her family.</p><p>And Elia kept going.</p><p>Because Alius would have wanted her to.</p><p>Because time may not be kind\u2026</p><p>\u2026but love always was.</p><hr><p><em>10 years later</em></p><p>The music drifted on a breeze that smelled faintly of blossoms and memory. Petals floated from the nearby trees as if the world itself was blessing this day.</p><p>Elia stood at the edge of the garden, hands folded around a bouquet of baby\u2019s breath - Alius\u2019s favorite flowers. Her golden hair was streaked with silver now, but her eyes held the same warm blue they always had. They shimmered today.</p><p>Her daughter was getting married.</p><p>Sellia laughed softly across the lawn, her gown trailing behind her like a river of moonlight. She was radiant. And not just in the usual way brides are. There was something else about her today - something familiar. A fire in her smile. A glow in her gaze. Elia saw him in every step she took.</p><p>Alius would\u2019ve been wrecked today.</p><p>He would\u2019ve cried during the vows, tried not to but failed. He would\u2019ve pulled Sellia into the tightest hug and whispered how proud he was. How beautiful she looked. He would\u2019ve danced too long at the reception, told every guest ten times over how lucky he was to be her dad.</p><p>Elia blinked slowly, breathing in through her nose.</p><p>There were pictures of him tucked in frames along the aisle. A locket around Sellia\u2019s neck. A small seat beside Elia left open, an old hoodie perched gently on top.</p><p>Sellia\u2019s voice pulled her out of the memory.</p><p>\u201CMom? Are you okay?\u201D</p><p>Elia turned, lips parting.</p><p>Sellia stood before her, bouquet in one hand, the other slightly raised like she was still uncertain she wasn\u2019t dreaming. Her smile was trembling now, just a little. It was the same look she had when she announced her engagement.</p><p>The same look Alius had when Sellia had said yes to his proposal.</p><p>\u201CWill you come with me?\u201D Elia asked, voice soft. \u201CJust for a moment?\u201D</p><p>Sellia smirked, but set her bouquet gently in the chair beside her before moving to follow her. \u201CNot an answer to my question, but sure.\u201D</p><p>They stepped away from the main path, just enough to be wrapped in shade and soft wind and the hush of the garden around them. Elia\u2019s hands were shaking now.</p><p>\u201CThere\u2019s something I need you to hold. Just for a bit,\u201D Elia said, reaching into the little clutch by her side and drawing out a folded envelope. The paper had yellowed slightly with age. It was worn at the edges, the ink faded, but the handwriting on the front was unmistakable.</p><p><em>To Sellia, on her wedding day.</em></p><p><em>- Dad</em></p><p>Sellia froze.</p><p>Her breath caught in her throat as her eyes locked onto the familiar scrawl. Her fingers reached for it hesitantly, as though it might vanish the moment she touched it. She took it from Elia with both hands, reverent, cradling it like something sacred.</p><p>For a long moment, she didn\u2019t move.</p><p>Then, slowly, Sellia sat down on the low stone bench behind her. Her gown pooled around her, forgotten. She broke the seal.</p><p>Elia stood back, watching.</p><p>Sellia\u2019s eyes scanned the page once. Then again. Her breath hitched - once, twice - and then the first tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>She pressed a hand to her mouth. A silent sob shook through her shoulders.</p><p>She read it all the way through, and then again, her lips trembling now as she mouthed some of the words like she was afraid she\u2019d lose them if she didn\u2019t say them out loud.</p><p>And then she broke.</p><p>Her whole body curled in around the letter, her forehead pressing to the parchment like if she could just get close enough, she might feel his heartbeat in the paper.</p><p>Elia knelt beside her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders, saying nothing.</p><p>Sellia clutched the letter to her chest.</p><p>\u201CHe really wrote this,\u201D she whispered. Her voice cracked like a fault line. \u201CHe really\u2026 he knew this day would come.\u201D</p><p>Elia nodded, tears slipping down her own cheeks now. \u201COf course he did. Who else has handwriting that bad?\u201D she teased.</p><p>Sellia laughed, the sound light as though a weight had lifted off her chest. \u201CI do, Mommy.\u201D</p><p>Elia leaned her forehead against her daughter\u2019s. \u201CObviously, you only got his best traits.\u201D</p><p>Sellia was crying freely now, but she smiled through it. A soft, devastated smile. The kind that comes from a love so deep it aches.</p><p>\u201CI miss him so much,\u201D she whispered.</p><p>\u201CI know, baby.\u201D Elia kissed her temple. \u201CI do too.\u201D</p><p>They stayed like that for a while - just mother and daughter, wrapped in the quiet ache of memory and the hush of wind through flowers.</p><p>Then Sellia straightened, folding the letter carefully, reverently, and tucking it close to her heart.</p><p>\u201CI think I\u2019m gonna have it framed. So, y\u2019know, gotta keep it safe.\u201D</p><p>Elia gave her daughter a knowing smile, but decided to hold back on the teasing. \u201CI think he\u2019d like that a lot.\u201D</p><p>They were interrupted by a man behind them, clearing his throat.</p><p>\u201CExcuse me. I believe they are ready for you.\u201D</p><p>Sellia blinked, then nodded. She turned to her mother and reached out.</p><p>\u201CCome with me?\u201D</p><p>Elia\u2019s heart stuttered. \u201CYou sure? You don\u2019t want-?\u201D</p><p>\u201CI want you.\u201D</p><p>So Elia took her hand, and they walked down the aisle together, arm in arm. Elia\u2019s steps were slow, steady, gentle. Sellia\u2019s were brave, firm, bright.</p><p>When they reached the front, Sellia leaned over and kissed her cheek.</p><p>\u201CFor Dad,\u201D she whispered. \u201CHe\u2019s here, right?\u201D</p><p>Her mother smiled through the tears building behind her lashes.</p><p>\u201CAlways.\u201D</p><hr><p><em>Dear Sellia,</em></p><p><em>If you&#39;re reading this\u2026 wow. You&#39;re probably in a dress. And you&#39;re probably rolling your eyes that I left something cheesy behind.</em></p><p><em>Sorry. I couldn&#39;t help myself.</em></p><p><em>The truth is, I always knew I&#39;d want to say something on this day. Even if I wasn\u2019t around to say it out loud.</em></p><p><em>I bet you look beautiful. I bet your smile lights up the whole world, just like your mom\u2019s always did. And I bet whoever\u2019s standing next to you right now - holding your hand, looking at you like you\u2019re their whole world - is the luckiest person alive.</em></p><p><em>I wish I could be there. More than anything.</em></p><p><em>But if I can&#39;t walk you down the aisle, if I can&#39;t tell you how proud I am while sobbing like a total mess and embarrass you in front of all your friends, then let me tell you here, in the only way I can:</em></p><p><em>You are the best thing I ever did.</em></p><p><em>You were light when the world got dark. You were laughter when I forgot how to smile. You are my greatest adventure.</em></p><p><em>I watched you grow into someone strong and kind and clever and stubborn (you get that from your mom). I watched you chase dreams, fall down, get back up - every single time. You always had this fire. You still do.</em><br><em>And today, you&#39;re not just starting a new chapter. You&#39;re building something of your own.</em><br><em>That\u2019s huge.</em></p><p><em>But you\u2019re not alone. You never have been.</em></p><p><em>I hope you carry love with you. I hope you fight for it, like your mom and I did. I hope you find joy in small things. In warm mornings and quiet nights. In your partner\u2019s laugh. In the family you choose. And I hope you know - no matter where I am - that I\u2019m cheering you on. Every step. Every breath.</em></p><p><em>When you dance tonight, save one for me, okay?</em><br><em>I\u2019ll be there.

Aware that he cannot make a change, that perhaps, answering this summoning was a meaningless task, there were still heroes that could answer this summon, it\u2019s an even more hopeless situation than the records he saw of the Battle against the Gods of Machines.<br> And yet even so, when he looks back, he sees a face that he can\u2019t feel like he cannot give up on, that exhausted face that is willing to spend all they have and more, just for the sake of living, he can\u2019t feel like running away now, even if it only buys a second, no, perhaps only a millisecond of time against this being of colossal proportions his mind cannot even begin to understand, he decided he should be here now, for those he truly considers \u201CHeroes\u201D, because he, no, because they knew, this time, it\u2019s not an option to retreat.<br> If it\u2019s to protect those dreams\u2026 those virtues\u2026 Don Quixote shall remain victorious until the very end after all</p><p>\u201CSancho.\u201D<br> \u201CYes, sir?\u201D<br> \u201CIt\u2019s time to go\u201D<br> \u201C...\u201D<br> \u201CMy lord, my Master! Watch, this will not be the first, nor the last time you see, for now, I, Don Quixote de La Macha, shall fell a Giant once more!\u201D</p><p>A barrage of light assaults their eyes as attacks come through, but even so, Magical Energy gathers, the Knight uses his Lance to try and attack, these attacks are practically meaningless, but that wasn\u2019t his goal from the start, his Sprint goes forward against one of the Legs of the titan in front of him, as his attendant is engulfed by bright light</p><p>\u201CO\u2019 Radiant Giant, my name is of no matter to you, but I shall say it again either way, I am Don Quixote, Don Quixote de La Mancha! In the name of my Lord, I shall strike you down! Sancho, Rocinante, no, Dulcinea! I\u2019d like you to be with me for this!\u201D<br> \u201C.... yes Sir!

One could almost imagine lush plains and windmills around them, as they slowly start to vanish, and crystalize, shattering<br> It only lasted but a moment, but that moment extended to ages, upon seeing the valiant knight fight for this seconds, it was as if a ephemeral shooting star had passed by, perhaps it didn\u2019t truly grant a wish, but as long as everyone believed it did, it would certainly come true, and as if to respond to that wish, heroes answered the call in response to their Master, and in response to those who have been left behind, it will certainly be alright, after all, Don Quixote always came victorious when it came to virtue. They will certainly carry this virtue, this hope, until the end of their journey.<br> How do I know this? Well, it\u2019s a Squire\u2019s task to record the great adventures of her Lord, right?</p><h2 id="thorne-the-last-day-of-deirdre-an-bhroin" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#thorne-the-last-day-of-deirdre-an-bhroin" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Thorne - The Last Day of Deirdre an Bhr\xF3in</h2><p>\u201CA majestic piece of work, isn\u2019t it?\u201D the man across me says, gesturing behind him to the imposing castle our carriage rides to. Less a palace and more a mass of iron and stone, the fortress sits on the edge of a bluff a ways past a lake I forget the name of, its presence far out-shadowing its size. Wicked spires sprout from its innards, glorified birdcages darkening the already cloudy sky. One of them will be mine soon.</p><p>\u201CI was surprised to hear you took my offer after all, you know,\u201D he continues, ignoring my silence, \u201CI mean, \xC9oghan mac Durthacht! I figured you\u2019d rather die than spend the rest of your years with him.\u201D</p><p>The man\u2019s name is Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster, and for the past year, he has been the foremost object of my hatred. Forced into becoming his unwilling bride, I have experienced first-hand what it means to be a hostage of his wanton lust for control; his desire to grasp what is not his \u2014 not anyone\u2019s \u2014 in the palm of his hand. Now that he has tired of me and my own unwillingness to play his games, he has found it fit to dispose of me, placing me in the hands of an equally detestable individual: \xC9oghan mac Durthacht, king of Fernmag, and the one who took <em>Him</em> from this world too soon. I ought to strangle him with my bare hands, grant all of them retribution, and yet\u2014</p><p>\u2014And yet, despite how righteous my vengeance burns, a cold seed of doubt nestles itself in my heart.</p><hr><p>It is a well-kept secret, one known only to a select few outside of those present at my birth, but since the moment I was born, those around me have been cursed to know naught but pain.</p><p>Perhaps it was a punishment from the gods, a cruel trick made to punish my father for a particularly irreverent performance. Perhaps my mother was more than she let on: I would never know, given she died in childbirth. Regardless, I have lived my life burdened by this curse of mine, born to have anyone I know idolize, but never truly love, me. It was for this reason that the sage Cathbad ordered that I be named Deirdre \u2014 broken-hearted, for the ruin I would bring should I be let to live, and the hole in my heart that would never be filled. There is a part of me that believes I should have died that night, had they and that bastard king Conchobar advised otherwise. If he had let his mind govern his decree and not his loins, as kings often do, Ulster would not find itself on the brink of undoneness as it does now. The seed whispers to me again, convincing me that if I had never been born, this suffering could have all been avoided.</p><p>Perhaps it is so, I think, but were that true, that would mean\u2026</p><p>There was a light in my life, once. Back when it was only Leabharcham and I surviving off the land, I was graced with a prophecy that would shape the course of my life thereafter. It told me of a hero with skin as fair as the winter snow, cheeks flushed blood-red, and hair as dark as the raven which supped from it. I begged her with all my heart to meet <em>Him</em>, to know <em>Him</em>, to hope against hope that if anyone would see me for who I truly was, it was <em>Him</em>.</p><p>I should have known that convincing her would be all of our undoings.</p><p>As promised, I met Him, and alongside His brothers, we eloped on a whirlwind romance far from the clutches of Conchobar and his men. Alas, the mad king eventually found us hidden in Alba, deceiving the great warrior Fergus mac R\xF3ich into returning us to him. With my words veiled in song and prophecy, I begged them not to return. That if we stayed here, they would not have to lay down their lives for my sake. Yet despite it all, they\u2014</p><hr><p>A bump in the road wrests me from my thoughts, the memories fading away as I am brought back to the present. The castle draws near, now. The imposing shadows it casts seem to stop right where the rocky patch of road we ride on ends, as if signaling the point of no return for our carriage; for me. The rocks around us sprout from the ground at jagged, sharp angles, wicked flowers in full bloom. A fitting setpiece for \xC9oghan, I muse. Gazing upon them fills me with an acute sense of dread, and yet, they almost seem to beckon for me, as if they know the pain of the flesh outweighs the anguish I stand to face. A plan, haphazard yet effective, forms.</p><p>Conchobar, miraculously, continues to prattle on, seemingly taunting me about something or other I cannot be bothered to hear anymore. The wheels in my head spin like lightning, a battle raging within as to whether I truly commit to this plan of mine; if death is truly better than chains. I try to reason with myself, the seed of doubt doing its best to justify my so-called penance, but in this moment, it is incinerated by my burning desire to be rid of it all. To be free.</p><p>I open the carriage door, and as I hang over the edge, wind tousling my once-fiery hair, I remember it all.</p><p>I remember how despite it all, they didn\u2019t listen. They, who insisted that they would protect me on their honor as warriors, died for their valor, impaled all at once by the loathsome \xC9oghan mac Durthacht, king of Fernmag. I was captured in the aftermath, another victim of Conchobar\u2019s conquests, and Fergus defected from Ulster in disgust. All according to the mad king\u2019s design, I suppose.</p><p>Perhaps I should have thrown myself in with them; had the minstrels romanticize our last moments as ones spent together. If for no one else, that would have saved me from the suffering I have endured this arduous year. I was too cowardly to do so back then, but I will not make the same mistake this time.</p><p>Conchobar\u2019s eyes widen as I fall wordlessly from the carriage, my face as stony as it has been this past year; as the rocks I will surely dash myself across. I will not permit him the mercy of understanding my feelings in these final moments, for those are only for myself and the gods above to know. As I fall, an emotion I have long repressed finally begins to awaken, and I scoff at it in my heart of hearts for having taken so long to blossom.</p><p>Hate, after all, is but another facet of love.</p><p>Time seems to slow as I remember that fateful day, when I lost everything to the spear of \xC9oghan mac Durthacht. That man, who killed my love, his brothers, and countless more; who Conchobar \u2018entrusted\u2019 me to\u2026 I despise him with all my heart. I wish the king he serves one thousand curses, for he let his love for a flower not yet bloomed overtake him, destroying us in his wanton pursuit of it. I hate this country for showering me in what they claim to be love. I take their happiness in its entirety and turn it to scorn for what they have done, what they have let pass and will let pass again. I am not the first that has done so, and I will not be the last.</p><p>And finally, after all is said and done, I quietly curse the name of my love, who \u2018loved\u2019 me enough to die for me but not enough to heed my words. You, who gave me the closest thing I knew to love, died too soon for us both.</p><p>It\u2019s okay, Naoise. I\u2019ll catch up to you soon.</p><h2 id="amala-the-computer-in-the-sea-of-the-moon" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#amala-the-computer-in-the-sea-of-the-moon" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Amala - The Computer in the Sea of the Moon</h2><p>I awaken in a sea of bright blue, fragments spiraling all around me as my mind awakens<br> within the confines of the, now secluded and isolated, space twisting around me. Vast as space<br> it spans, spiraling more and more within my sight as the <strong><span style="color:#0020FF;">Moon Cell</span></strong> proceeds to coil labyrinthine<br> see through corridors around me; digital vastness showing me everything and nothing<br> simultaneously. The effigy behind me, as silent as the sinking depths around me,<br> accompanying the past within me. Walking forward, my brain proceeds to go into overdrive,<br> passing digital bubbles and divine essence. The agitation through the <strong><span style="color:#9900FF;">Spiritron</span></strong> digitization<br> coursing through me creates an overwhelming, if slightly terrifying, depth of emptiness; knowing<br> that I do not know myself or my surroundings, yet knowledge of these divine depths proceeds to<br> usher me to an empty room of other souls, black darkness surrounding me amidst the chaos,<br> dead, killed by the solid and calculating effigies around. Things blur as the effigy behind me tried<br> to defend myself; the wood failing as it collapses to its duplicate. As I now find myself at a loss,<br> the other knocks me down; the blood of my soul pouring out from within en masse. I can\u2019t die, I<br> can\u2019t die, I can\u2019t die, say this broken mind of mine, as I try to stand; wobbling and seeing red,<br> with a searing on my hand clear as day as the <strong><span style="color:#FF0021;">Command Seal</span></strong> appears;bringing forth what<br> appears to be a regal woman in red, beauty piercing through the dark as my mind fades asking<br> me a question I had failed to hear from my <strong><span style="color:#72761D;">Servant</span></strong> earlier \u201C Now then, I shall ask you once<br> more.
