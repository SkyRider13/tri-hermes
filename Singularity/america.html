you, punk? I really want to get this over with.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...Damn you!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The amount of curses covering your body...They&#39;re strong enough for you to shoulder an entire nation!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Damn you! If you possess this much strength...Why? Why have you fallen to Ravana&#39;s level!?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Your skill is not something that can be given, but obtained only through sheer will and determination!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> You could&#39;ve transcended good and evil! It shouldn&#39;t be possible for you to be corrupted like this!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Huh? What are you talking about? I&#39;m like this because I&#39;ve transcended good and evil.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I kill my enemies. I will keep killing until one of us dies. That&#39;s the only law on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Look at this mountain of corpses! Is it your law to slaughter the weak with overwhelming brutality!?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Why would I waste my time worrying about something so trivial?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> What? Don&#39;t tell me you actually judge your enemy&#39;s worth? You would let them live if they&#39;re weak, yet kill them if they&#39;re strong?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> —That&#39;s ridiculous. If you want to kill something in a humane way, do it at a ranch.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> This is a battlefield. I&#39;m tired of hearing your theories. Just die.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s go time, my demonic thorn of death!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Ugh! Brahmastra, full power!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Ha! See, you do have it in you. Too bad, you&#39;re just a circus clown.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Gáe–Bolg!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...Gaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> –What? How are you still standing?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> What a pain. You still hang on to life despite having 80% of your heart destroyed. Servants–Heroes, can be such a nuisance.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Gar...Hah...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t...die here...Not...until I see...Sita!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Who the hell is that? Like I care.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...Ugh...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Servant response confirmed. Commencing countermeasures.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> ...That trash from the West, huh?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Now, Geronimo!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> What&#39;s...going on?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Just come with me! We have to escape while they keep him busy!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Who...Who are you?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I see now. You all want to get in my way. In that case, you&#39;re all my enemies.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> In other words, this is a new battlefield! Let me first extend my welcome by killing you!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Geronimo, go! We&#39;ll hold him off here!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Thank you!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Hah! Ready to sacrifice yourself? Well, look at you! Your morale is pretty high for a mere pawn!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> We won&#39;t...lose...This land...will not...yield!</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Oops, I screwed up. He was too annoying so I just crushed him.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> He pointed his blade toward the king of a nation. I really should just cut off his head and display it as a warning but...I guess there are more where he came from.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Hey punk, let&#39;s continue. I&#39;ve already crushed your insides. How about I go for your skull next and–</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> ...What the hell, he&#39;s gone already.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Tch, that&#39;s no fun. Oh well, injuries from my spear&#39;s thorn are incurable. He&#39;ll eventually die.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> –Hehehe, you look braver than ever. Say, which do you like better, to fight, or to kill?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Huh? Is there any difference?</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Or what? Are you one of those idiots who think of eating and living as two separate things?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re funny, Cú. You really are different. You&#39;re like a wild beast.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Even in life, there was a part of you that somehow felt like a beast in human&#39;s clothing...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> But this time, I can&#39;t sense a single trace of impurity! You&#39;re without a doubt a king among all violent beasts!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Truly fantastic. I wonder if the hero Cú Chulainn lost all his rationality by being given an imaginary concept.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> But I like both forms of Cú. Hehe, hehehe, hehehehe!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s number thirty...Huh? Woman, did you say something?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Either way, job&#39;s done. I&#39;m going to sleep now. Wake me up if anything happens.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Oh boy. I&#39;m happy to see you all rough and tough, but it&#39;s a shame you&#39;re strangely indifferent now.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s fine either way. You probably won&#39;t have much chance to show off anymore.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Because from here on, it&#39;s my turn! Here comes the innocent, perfect, much beloved Queen Medb☆</p><p><strong>Celtic Warrior:</strong><br> ...What are your orders?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Come, my warriors! It&#39;s time to advance our troops! Sing my praises, loudly!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Praise me, and kill my enemies! Medb is the best!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, my dear and sweet warriors! Come on, we&#39;re almost there!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This nation! This land! Everything will be ours!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Eternal, an eternal nation. We&#39;ll create a utopia!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If they oppose me, kill them! If they don&#39;t oppose me, still kill them!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Foolish civilians, unwise leaders, and weak soldiers! I need none of them!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The United States will be no more, and from its ashes we&#39;ll create a new nation.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be an eternal nation only for us! One centered around us!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> How&#39;s his condition?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Terrible. It&#39;s amazing he could stay alive.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> So he&#39;s a Servant, too. Like you...Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes...We need as much manpower as we can get. Tell the shaman to give him the best treatment possible.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But...things won&#39;t get better as they are now.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Geronimo, can we talk for a minute?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Moments ago, the last fort in the East fell. The United Western States has retreated from the East.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> The East-West Civil War will drag on longer than it should. So it means–</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This place will turn into what the missionary called “Purgatory. ”</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> What&#39;s the difference between Purgatory and Hell?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No big difference. In either case, it is going to be harsh for us.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> What are we going to do?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You guys should continue infiltrating the Western forces in those costumes.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Although many non-human creatures lurk among the Celts, the Western troops still have a lot of humans.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes, understood.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. The star is finally starting to show movement. It seems the Mage&#39;s Association is getting serious...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Wait, no. Perhaps the world is not moving, it&#39;s revolving.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I hope...that this starlight is something that we can be proud of...</p><p><strong>--SECTION BREAK--</strong></p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> —I woke up at the same time today.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I checked my temperature. I checked my five senses. I said my name out loud, so that I could understand it better.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I think I&#39;ve gotten quite used to waking up like this. Previously, my wake-up was a bit more gradual.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> It was as if I was walking on thin ice,or sneaking in front of an animal in a blissful sleep.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s how I used to wake up. Like I was looking for my way in complete darkness.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Of course it&#39;s different now. My self-consciousness is stable. I don&#39;t have to worry about my memory disappearing after each sleep.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I am who I am. Today, too, I can feel that I am myself.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Good morning. You&#39;re on time as usual. Ready for breakfast?</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Your brain waves are stable. If you continue like this, you won&#39;t need to stay in this sterile chamber anymore.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Then you can finally be a researcher at Chaldea. I will throw a celebration for you when that day comes.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Do you have any requests? I&#39;ll try to get you anything within my capabilities.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I couldn&#39;t think of what I wanted,but I thought of something I wanted to do.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Though I knew this comfortable room was more than enough, I wanted to go outside, just once.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Well. You&#39;ll get out pretty soon.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> What I want to give you is more like a gift, not something simple like what you just said...</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I expressed my intention by shaking my head.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> What I wanted to see was not outside of my room, but Chaldea. I wanted to see the outside world with my own eyes, not through pictures.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh, I see...So you want to actually see the sea and the grass field from the VR program I showed you the other day.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> That&#39;ll be difficult. Chaldea is on top of a snowy mountain, 6,000 meters above sea level.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Part of it is to prevent top secrets from leaking. Either way, you&#39;ll see nothing but a blizzard if you go outside.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Maybe you can see the ravine when the weather clears up once a year.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Even so, your body can&#39;t withstand the outside world. I think it&#39;s best for you to change your way of thinking.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> If you want to see nature then VR is enough. It&#39;s not worth it for you to shorten your already short activation period.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> His smile seemed so troubled, like he was sorry for me. His gaze avoided mine.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> ...It made me feel terribly sorry. I suppose what I said made him feel sad.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> Oh, but you&#39;ll be free anywhere within Chaldea. I will take responsibility and make sure to get the Director&#39;s approval.</p><p><strong>B：???:</strong><br> You can rest assured and wait for that day to come. I will think of a gift for you.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> “Thank you,” I replied.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> It was hard for me to think about what I wanted, but I was happy that anyone would care that much about me.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> I am very, very happy.</p><p><strong>A：???:</strong><br> Because today, I can spend another peaceful day without changes.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...That dream just now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...How was that happiness?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Fooou?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wait...Am I crying?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s this feeling, in my heart?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Kyuuu...Fou, fooou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup, times like this call for a doctor.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. You&#39;re here to see the Doctor for something?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, is that Fujimaru? I&#39;m glad you are here. I need your help convincing her.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mash fights in the front lines too much these days. As her physician I think she should take a break...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s not necessary. Senpai should be under the same conditions.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As long as Senpai is fighting, I can&#39;t find any reason for me to rest.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As you can see, she&#39;s insisting that she follow you. Fujimaru, what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I won&#39;t stop her if she wants to come.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> See? You are being overprotective, Doctor. You are the commander, so please keep your composure.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And thank you, Senpai. I will do my best to match your expectations.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash will be fine. I&#39;ll protect her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. I believe in you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sigh...Oh boy. Though I am happy she&#39;s become so dependable in the short while that I wasn&#39;t looking...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s also true that things can be inconvenient unless Fujimaru is accompanied by Mash...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fine, I will allocate more budget to Mash&#39;s health management. But don&#39;t force too much on her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No need to worry, Doctor. Self-management is one of the things I&#39;m good at.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll tell Senpai immediately if I don&#39;t feel well. We must stay alert at all times during a Grand Order.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Even a slight decrease in my performance would put Master in danger, so I won&#39;t hesitate to state my requests.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll ask for medical attention when injured, and I&#39;ll ask for sweets when I need sugar.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As far as that goes, I can guarantee you I am on top of that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmmm, you&#39;ve really become quite dependable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s a call from the Command Room. They&#39;re ready for the next Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get going, Fujimaru, Mash. We&#39;ll start with a briefing as usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s hurry up, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> ...Fooou...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t get a chance to ask the Doctor...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Well, it&#39;s not like he&#39;s going anywhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s start the briefing. The rest of Chaldea&#39;s staff, please pay attention as well.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> After the battle in London, we now know our enemy is the King of Mages, Solomon.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;re lucky we obtained all sorts of information...Though it was likely on purpose.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Out of all the information we received, here&#39;s the important detail–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He will not attack us.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> The King of Mages won&#39;t fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It seems Solomon doesn&#39;t care about us taking down the other three Singularities.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He made it clear that he won&#39;t attack us until then. Whatever the purpose, it doesn&#39;t look like he&#39;s lying.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So, we can continue with our mission of correcting the Singularities?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes. First, we&#39;ll return human history back to its proper course. The problem is—</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> How to deal with the King of Mages, right? Grand Caster...He stands above all mages.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like the fact that there&#39;s a Caster who ranks higher than me, but I suppose it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Inserting the reincarnated Demon Gods into each era...That&#39;s not something an ordinary person would think of.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> As a genius myself, I must admit...We currently have no idea how to track him, let alone defeat him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. We don&#39;t know how to track him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I hear the King of Mages had 72 Demon Gods serving under him. We&#39;ve defeated at least three of them, that means–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There are 69 left...But there&#39;s no point counting them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If he&#39;s indeed the Grand Caster, he can replenish the lost Demon Gods as much as he wants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yes, the familiar known as the “72 Demon Gods” is one single ritual, one single concept.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In that case, all 72 of them must always exist.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As long as they call themselves “Demon Gods,” all 72 pillars will continue to be around Solomon regardless of shape or form.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So you mean there is no end?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. Unless we defeat King Solomon, the summoner, the 72 Demon Gods will never disappear from this planet.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What are they? Octopus tentacles?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...I don&#39;t think they look that delicious...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...But using marine life as an analogy might be getting to the point...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmm...It reminds me of something I&#39;ve seen in a picture book...But I can&#39;t remember...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I know we&#39;re in the dark regarding Solomon, but we do know what we have to do.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s think about how to get rid of the Demon Gods after we&#39;re done with that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s start talking about our current coordinates. This is a place that would surprise any mage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Where is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> North America. A superpower known as the “United States of America. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can&#39;t exclude this nation from history.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This nation is insignificant when it comes to Magecraft, but historically it&#39;s as important as Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Insignificant when it comes to Magecraft...I see, the Doctor is correct.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that the United States is still a young nation, and there&#39;re no official records of it ever holding a Holy Grail War.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hahaha. To me it&#39;s just the place that said I put codes in my paintings.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> When would I have time to do something like that when I&#39;m painting? Even if I did, I&#39;d only do it to spite my client.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That aside, it&#39;s not like they&#39;re completely void of Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Apparently, they&#39;ve developed their own style of Magecraft that could summon an Elemental down to Earth.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I also confirmed that Heroic Spirits existed.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> There are deep-rooted legends of outlaws who would rebel against anything in that nation.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Obviously, we can&#39;t treat this like places we&#39;ve encountered before. I want you to proceed with your search carefully.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> —Then I&#39;ll start the Rayshift. Master Fujimaru, please start your preparations.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Unsummon Program, start. Spiritron Conversion, start.</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> Rayshift starting in 3, 2, 1...</p><p><strong>Announcement A:</strong><br> All procedures cleared. Grand Order, commencing operation.</p><h2 id="section-1-feet-on-the-ground-eyes-on-the-stars" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-1-feet-on-the-ground-eyes-on-the-stars" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 1: Feet on the Ground, Eyes on the Stars</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. The Rayshift was successful, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re in a forest somewhere in America in the year 1783.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...To be precise, we are on the continent of North America...The United States hasn&#39;t been born yet.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Once the Revolutionary War against England ends this year, the nation later known as “America” will be established.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> After that, this nation will turn into a monster-like mega power that dominates this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Whether that&#39;s good or not, there&#39;s no doubt that this nation is absolutely essential for the proper course of history.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Is England the enemy?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who is the enemy?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s say America loses the war, and the nation known as the United States never comes into existence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right, though that certainly is a possibility, the mere result of the Revolutionary War won&#39;t change the flow of history.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As long as America has shown its will for independence, even if that process gets delayed for 30 to 50 years...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eventually the United States of America will be established.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as “England is our enemy. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry, I know you&#39;ve just arrived but we have a bit of an issue! I&#39;ve detected a large scale battle just ahead!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know the details, but please hurry! This is not an ordinary battle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is...</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Stand your ground, elites of the glorious Mechanized Infantry Brigade!

Senpai, it&#39;s Mr. Babbage!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Calm down, Mash. That&#39;s not him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Calm down, Mash. It&#39;s nothing.</p><hr><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The other side is...a lot more retro-looking!</p><p><strong>Mechanized Soldier:</strong><br> —Oh, terrible. Enemy reinforcements spotted. Firing warning shots, then proceeding to exterminate!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The guns are pointed at us—Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For now, let&#39;s fight back!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Master! This is our first battle on North American soil, I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> I-Impossible!

Hurry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hah...Hah...We did it, Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t grasp the situation yet, but it seems one side has retreated—</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> —!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Be careful!

Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! Senpai is airborne!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Mash, what did you just say?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You know, airborne!

But I&#39;m at least certain that it&#39;s not the British army.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And there&#39;s one more thing. This army is strange, too. The American flag they&#39;re flying isn&#39;t what it&#39;s supposed to be...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...and the ones they sent in to fight...were the same things we encountered in London.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Things...Homunculi?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, unfortunately, that&#39;s not what they are. I&#39;ll give you some hints: the smell of oil, looks like iron...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re the robot army?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s it. Charles Babbage, the King of Steam. These things were the same as his production model.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hi, Fujimaru. Um...So that was a disaster, huh?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any case, what you&#39;ve encountered was probably due to the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what they are, and there are many mysteries about this army you&#39;ve joined up with...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But what I can be certain of is that someone is trying to prevent the United States of America from being established.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If the United States isn&#39;t established, it will cause a logical error in this world.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Aside from the “anchor” that King Solomon used, I believe other powerful Servants are appearing in this era.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we&#39;re not going to change our methods.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> We&#39;ll keep looking for help from Servants who are already summoned.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...And, I fully understand how you&#39;d be nervous about this, but I think we should ask the Servant that&#39;s in front of us now.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> She seems dependable...I think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, when you say it like that, it almost sounds like this isn&#39;t your problem...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No, I&#39;m just a little scared. Just a little. I&#39;m not good with nurses who are too serious...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But you two aren&#39;t me. That&#39;s a battlefield, not an infirmary!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Besides, we can&#39;t afford to be picky! Just try talking to her, Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Actually...I proposed that earlier...but it didn&#39;t work. She won&#39;t listen.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why not?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Seeing how she talks and acts, I have no doubt that her class is Berserker, and–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can&#39;t be certain yet, but her True Name is probably...Florence Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Did we get a new patient?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t call my name unless you need me. All right, the treatment is done.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Keep the wounds clean, you hear me?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Thank you...very much...Are you...an angel?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Angels don&#39;t give out beautiful flowers,they&#39;re the ones who fight for those in distress.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If you&#39;re in agony, yet still choose to fight–Then I will be there for you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I knew it, you&#39;re Florence Nightingale, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –I fail to see how that makes any difference.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please help us. Unless we correct the Singularity–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t bring up such foolishness. I have patients here waiting for me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is the only reason and motivation for my being summoned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s a way to save them all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s a way to treat them all.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s that now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You heard that right. May I, Ms. Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No matter how hard you struggle,the number of patients will keep increasing.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In a normal war, the number of casualties slow down somewhere along the line.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> However, this is no normal war. This enemy will fight until the last man is dead.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You say the patient count will keep increasing?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, unfortunately. That&#39;s exactly why we need to cut it off at the root.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Enemy raid, enemy raid!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You there, sir! Is the enemy the same as before?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Anyone who can walk, prepare to engage! The mechanized brigade won&#39;t get here in time! So get the cannons ready!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s fight with them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If we can&#39;t maintain the front line here,the patients will...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I know!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We can&#39;t let them attack this camp!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Wait. I&#39;ll go with you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Despite my appearance, I know a thing or two about combat. But most of all, I can&#39;t let these patients be injured anymore.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Doctor Rush! Please treat these patients just the way I told you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The patients who mustn&#39;t be moved are housed in the big tent. I want to move them, but that would risk their lives more.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Those who can walk on their own, please help those who can&#39;t. When you do, be very careful not to touch their wounds.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I won&#39;t let the enemy reach this tent. This is our sanctuary.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> R-Right. But...Who are you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m a nurse. Nothing more, nothing less. Follow me, Servant!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right!</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> ...Th-That&#39;s a nurse?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Okay, time for treatment. I&#39;ll remove the infected parts right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-Calm down, okay? ...After another look, it seems our enemy can move better than humans.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, let&#39;s fight. This is the front line. We can&#39;t win if we don&#39;t hold them here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here I go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> More are on the way. They&#39;re more powerful than the ones before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We&#39;ve become more powerful as well.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right! Let&#39;s keep going!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s a stalemate. For them, it may have been their first Servant battle ever.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll reach the tent, but–Mm. Mm, mm. Mm.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> –Detecting enemy Servants. Two of them!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Your Majesty. We&#39;ve found them.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Apparently they&#39;re Servants. I can see why our troops aren&#39;t pushing onward.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> This is probably as far as the unsung warriors can go. Now it&#39;s our turn to step up.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Just what I&#39;d expect from my subordinate, Diarmuid Ua Duibhne. Your eyes are, yes, if I were to compare, akin to a hawk&#39;s!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...You are too kind. Compared to your wisdom, Fionn mac Cumhaill, I am nothing.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha! Enough with the modesty. You have an eye for beauty. The fact that you chose Gráinne proves it.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...N-No. I wouldn&#39;t...say that...Uh...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Sorry, I was only joking! That was a bit mean of me! Now, let&#39;s fight!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Let&#39;s show them the power of the Knights of Fianna! And...let&#39;s bring an eternal empire to this fertile land!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> As you wish! Now, ladies. Prepare yourselves.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne,the best spearman in the Knights of Fianna.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Diarmuid...the “radiant-faced” Diarmuid Ua Duibhne.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And standing right behind him is his lord,Fionn mac Cumhaill...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In other words, you two are pathogens.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Pathogens? No, we&#39;re just warriors. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Whoa!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> —With your death, I shall eradicate this disease!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Ugh...So you don&#39;t listen to what people say, huh? I don&#39;t like it, I really don&#39;t like such women...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You were caught off guard, Diarmuid! Leave it to me, I&#39;ll heal your wounds!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My lord, I am grateful. Please accept my apologies. Forgive me, I was overwhelmed.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha, that&#39;s my “Ladykiller” Diarmuid. So you&#39;re not comfortable taking on women?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No...I wouldn&#39;t say...Uh...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha! I jest, I jest! That was a pretty good one, too!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> But no need to worry. They&#39;re both good-looking, powerful women.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I don&#39;t blame you for holding back. Now then, I shall head out myself.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> In the name of the glorious Knights of Fianna,I shall claim their heads!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Lancer, Fionn mac Cumhaill...here I come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hmm. To think they&#39;re more than a match for both of us. Quite impressive...Are they seasoned veterans?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, we couldn&#39;t finish them off!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Wait! What&#39;s this...The wounded back at the camp...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wait, what? Nightingale, where are you going?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, my, I think she&#39;s noticed.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh unknown Shielder Servant. This Holy Grail War is by all means...a war.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> As far as we&#39;re concerned, we only needed to keep you here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no! The other soldiers!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> They&#39;re nameless warriors. Just unique monsters who will continue to fight.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Of course, they&#39;re no match for Servants...But I wonder...How about the American troops?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...! Your Majesty, please retreat!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> –What?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Right flank, left flank, surround the enemy! We&#39;re going to charge down the middle!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> They&#39;re beasts who only process what&#39;s right before them! But we have wisdom!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Is that...the much-rumored Resistance? If there are more Servants, there&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Fine. We&#39;ll retreat for now, Diarmuid! Give the order to the other warriors as well!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Very well. But will they be able to comprehend our orders?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hmm? If they don&#39;t, it can&#39;t be helped. We&#39;ll abandon them. Come on, don&#39;t feel bad.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> They&#39;re monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won&#39;t be a problem for us!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Indeed, my liege. All right...Let us retreat.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Oh, before we do, I forgot something important. Oh beautiful Demi-Servant.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-Do you mean me?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, I mean you. Are you determined to oppose us?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Along with my Master, we will defeat you.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> That&#39;s a beautiful gaze, full of sincerity. I shall forgive your transgression for showing me such a wonderful gaze.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> In return...If you&#39;re defeated, I shall have your heart! That&#39;s right, you shall become my wife!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Excuse me?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait, I really can&#39;t wait! A truly blissful promise! Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...(There he goes again, just like that...)</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Pardon us. It&#39;s a bad habit of my king&#39;s. You might think it&#39;s a prank, but he actually never lies.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> He must&#39;ve fallen for the sight of you fighting so bravely. If you&#39;re defeated, please consider surrender and submission.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now, then, farewell! Fare thee well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um. What was that last part about?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> He proposed to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He asked for your hand in marriage.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-Is that right? Well, that was a bit of a...surprise.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...I have no comment on the man himself,but his words did have an impact...or should I say...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I felt like my heart skipped a beat...Sorry, let me take a deep breath.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey! Are you okay? Looks like the enemy Servants are gone for now...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...but now a different Servant has appeared. It&#39;s heading your way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s join Nightingale right away!</p><h2 id="section-3-fragment-of-the-star" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-3-fragment-of-the-star" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 3: Fragment of the Star</h2><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Green, I&#39;m out of ammo. Cover me.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Gotcha.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> By the way, why do you call me “Green”? Who&#39;s this “Green”?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I mean, you and I are both Archers, right? So we either call each other by our True Names or use code names.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> But neither of us wants to use our True Names, right? You know, as outlaws.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m no outlaw. That&#39;s just how it turned out. Basically, I&#39;m just a lazy-ass.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Say, if you were an animal you would be a gorilla, right? I mean, Druids are like sages of the forest? Then you would be a gori–</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Green is fine, just call me Green. And why are you “Thunder”?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Huh? It sounds cool, no? Thunder. Plus it&#39;s the name of my gun.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...To be honest, between this land, what you wear, and that gun, I have a pretty good idea of your True Name. Is that okay?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Come on, I can say the same for you. Faceless ruler of the forest, specialist in guerilla warfare.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s not good to go without a face. Now that we&#39;re done with idle chatter—</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Right, now that we&#39;re done—What do we do with this?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> How&#39;s that escape hatch we made?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s good. We can use it. It&#39;d just be a shame to, that&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> After we gathered up all these weapons and ammo......Hmm, maybe we overdid it?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Well, after all that sabotage, I&#39;d say a bit.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Doesn&#39;t seem like they have any Servants over there,but we&#39;re done for if they engage in close combat.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Well, it&#39;s all in fate&#39;s hands now. Want me to pray for the Master to come to our aid?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Are you mad? Were your prayers ever answered in life?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Why, sure. But you have to be a good boy.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t worked since I became an adult. I guess we&#39;re both just bad boys?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Hmph, speak for yourself! I always said my prayers, just like my mom taught me.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. I&#39;m sure if you pray from the bottom of your heart, we&#39;ll be saved.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Mmm, I guess praying in your spare time doesn&#39;t work. Well, I–</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> was expecting that, too.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Praying while blasting away with your gun won&#39;t do a thing. I mean, God can&#39;t hear your prayers over the gunshots.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Whoa, someone fell for it. I&#39;ll go light &#39;em up.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Yeah, knock yourself out.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> ...Still, I&#39;m tired. I wonder how long the Resistance is gonna hold out.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Sooner or later, they&#39;ll reach their limit. I just hope Geronimo finds the “star” by then–</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Whoa, that was close. The “Regulators” are closed for today. Please visit us another day. See ya!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please give me a moment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m in the middle of telling Dr. Rush how to care for the patients.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Honestly, though this is long before I was born, there is too little risk management concerning sanitation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> R-Right...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Listen to me. The wounds must be kept clean, and don&#39;t lay beds edge-to-edge.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Normally, I would never let patients lie down on the filthy ground.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Giving them vomit-inducing medication or bloodletting to expel toxins, or having them drink mercury chloride...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If you perform outdated treatments like that again, I will punch you until you need treatment yourself. You&#39;ve been warned.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> But those are the latest techniques...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Which is the latest, this gun or that treatment? Don&#39;t make me repeat myself.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> U-Understood! Understood! I understand! Please, no more guns, latest or not!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Also, treat all patients equally, regardless of age, gender, race, or social status.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The only discrimination is the order they receive treatment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t follow those rules, this bullet will go through your forehead, even if I&#39;m 5,000 kilometers away.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...You got all that, Benjamin Rush? Please take good care of the patients.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> I-I will. You can be assured of that!</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> She&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> ...Still, she&#39;s an outstanding nurse for being so radical.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> “Regardless of race” are brave words in this day and age.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> Seems she came from Europe. She must be famous over there.</p><p><strong>Doctor:</strong><br> ...I have issues with that gun, though...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...Did you just fire that?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s your imagination. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it isn&#39;t my imagination. You just fired that without hesitation.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I just used the back of its blade.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Do guns have blades?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If I have to guess...I think she means the bottom of the grip. You just lightly tap the back of the head like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I know. You can do that with shields, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Of course. The trick is to strike gently, and at the moment of impact, shift the strike point...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Excuse me, please refrain from idle chatter during treatment. Come, let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, right! My apologies!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...Senpai. Is it normal to feel a little bit worried?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fouuu.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Wait, Florence. Where do you think you&#39;re going?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Do you know that leaving your post in the military is an offense that can get you shot?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Get back to your post now. Or else harsh punishment will be waiting for you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...You go back to your post.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My job has not changed at all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I feel like I almost found a way to treat the soldiers&#39; ailments at their core, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Oh, really? That is reasonable. Thank you. But—</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t let a Berserker like you wander off like that. What happens if you end up disrupting our troops?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The king would never approve of this.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...The king? Someone like that has absolutely no right to stop me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Unless you have a better way to treat the soldiers. I&#39;m all ears.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Sheesh, you really can&#39;t talk to a Berserker. I wonder what I should do.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> We&#39;ve never seen eye to eye, so maybe this is a good chance to get rid of you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Well, that&#39;s not very kind of you, but I feel the same way. That saves me some trouble.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yikes...We&#39;ve got sparks flying over here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Why is it when two strong-minded women clash, it always turns into a bloodbath like this?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Doctor, calm down.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think this is happening because they&#39;re both correct, and stubborn in their own way!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, we can&#39;t let them kill each other! Senpai, may I intervene?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, please intervene!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Roger that. I&#39;m not confident, but I&#39;ll do my best!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Pardon me for interrupting! Are you...a Servant too?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Too? You mean...Oh! So many Servants! Great!</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> When I heard the Celts were driven away,I assumed Florence had lost her mind again...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> But it seems I was wrong. So this is good news for the king?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> King?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Oh, you don&#39;t know America&#39;s current situation? This country has split into two, and now the two sides are at war with each other.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> The other side is good-for-nothing savages who just want to destroy.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> And there&#39;s our side–the United Western States, led by our king.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a civil war between the East and the West...not the North and the South.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So it&#39;s not even “What if the South won the Civil War? ”but a clash between two unknown armies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, pardon me, miss. What&#39;s your name?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Oh. You recognized Florence at a glance,but you don&#39;t know me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I&#39;m sorry...Ms. Nightingale was...Um, anyway, it was easy to guess...</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s okay, I&#39;m only giving you a hard time. Please forgive my childishness.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t introduce myself earlier. I am Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, I suppose I&#39;m known more as Madame Blavatsky. I didn&#39;t appreciate having to change my maiden name.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Helena Blavatsky! The poster girl for 19th-century occultism!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A talented woman independent from the Mage&#39;s Association who codified occultism with only her distinctive powers–</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But seeing as how you&#39;re a Servant here,are you acting as an agent for the Mage&#39;s Association?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> No. In this world, all major nations other than America are completely destroyed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who is this king?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So who do you serve?</p><hr><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;re the Master. What a pity. We have already decided who to serve.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s the king. If he conquers the globe, I have no problem with it.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I believe we&#39;d become Lemuria, breaking away from other dimensions and continuing to wander.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Kind of like the Throne of Heroes. Don&#39;t you think that is a happy ending in its own way?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –I can&#39;t accept that as treatment. Amputating the bad part and then walking away is outrageous.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...Well, I figured you would say that. But what do you think?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A definite no!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, I see.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> No, ma&#39;am!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I must admit to being a little irritated. “Ma&#39;am. ” What is this “ma&#39;am”?</p><hr><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...Ahem. Well then, where are you people taking Florence?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...In order to prevent the destruction of this world, we intend to remove the cause.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I see. Then I suppose that makes us enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, it doesn&#39;t have to be like that. Would you please let us go?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re just leaving here with Nightingale as our ally.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Hmph. Then you are able to understand Florence&#39;s will.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That makes me somewhat relieved,but I still can&#39;t let you go.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Not even Mash could convince her...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So the punchline to this venture is that there aren&#39;t any Servants joining our side?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There is one!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> One right here!</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m done talking. Let&#39;s go, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to waste a minute or even a second. I&#39;m going to cure this war.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> R-Right. Anyway, she&#39;s on our side and we&#39;re just barely managing to communicate with her!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Escape from there with Nightingale!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Ahhh, you leave me no choice. Now I have to call out my elites.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> We&#39;ll start with them. Mechanized infantry, come forward!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The production model Babbages from earlier!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, have you encountered Mr. Babbage? Have you been to 19th-century England?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...Oh, I see. He was defeated, wasn&#39;t he? Poor man.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> But these won&#39;t lose. After all, the king personally “worked” on them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> “Worked” on them?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Babbage used the powers of the Grail and Noble Phantasm to produce his clones. However, the power of science was used here to mass-produce these.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Even if the result is the same, the approach differs. And if the approach differs, the result will too.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, quoting our king...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> “Of course electricity is better than steam, you fool! ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-They&#39;re electric?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m fired up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> That&#39;s so cool!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, seeing your eyes glitter like that worries me a little...b-but anyway, here I go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We defeated them! Be they steam-powered or electric, once they&#39;re broken the victory is ours!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> An obvious truth. But it all ends here.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Okay, Karna! Hurry up and finish them off!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What...Umm, I&#39;m sorry. What did you just say?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s my turn? Understood.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa! All of a sudden I&#39;m picking up a Servant response! It&#39;s right above you!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Forced teleportation...Command Spell!? ...What&#39;s going on!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The readings I&#39;m getting from his Spirit Origin are off the charts!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh no...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Sorry, but could you go ahead and capture them? I mean, it looks like they&#39;re enemies for the time being.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;ll oblige to your frivolous conjecture.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Travelers from afar, pardon the rough welcome. –Brahmastra!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Retreat...Oh no, he&#39;s too fast!</p><h2 id="section-4-king-of-presidents" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-4-king-of-presidents" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 4: King of Presidents</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, Senpai! I&#39;m so glad, you woke up!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What on earth happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> My head hurts...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Your Servant blocked that Noble Phantasm attack. However, its shockwave knocked everyone unconscious.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> While our lives were spared,it appears that we are in their custody now.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, so you&#39;re awake. Right now we&#39;re in the midst of transporting you.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You can run away if you like...But, the bad news is that these babies will target the Master, aggressively.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Though Karna probably won&#39;t do a thing, since he&#39;s firm on his policy of not killing a Master.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s a misunderstanding. I will kill a Master first depending on the situation.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Of course, first you must show me that you have the reason, conviction, and determination to convince me to kill a Master.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> For instance, is the one issuing the order willing to exchange their own life for it?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, I am willing to consider.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> See, he says stuff that&#39;s basically unthinkable on a battlefield.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s how Karna is,but that doesn&#39;t change your situation in the slightest.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> At such close range, it would be quite difficult to slip past the mechanized infantry, don&#39;t you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Now, now, be good.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Where are we headed?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What do you want?</p><hr><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> First, I&#39;ll have you meet my king. You should decide which side to be on after that.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, I know the two Servants sitting right there won&#39;t side with us that easily. That much I&#39;m sure of.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> However, I&#39;m sure things will be different if we can persuade the Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Umm, Lady Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Why is it that you go to such lengths to take the side of this “king”?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Lady! I like the sound of that. You&#39;re a nice girl. You understand etiquette!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Your name is Mash, right? In light of your proper manners, I shall answer you.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> The biggest reason why I support the king is that we were closely connected when we were alive.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s not like we had an affair or anything like that. We kept in close contact, and I owe him a lot...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> The Celts who dominate the East won&#39;t accept anyone other than themselves.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Even if I surrendered to the Celts, they would just kill me. Or maybe they would sacrifice me for the sake of their war.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The Celts...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Those Servants you saw earlier were Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne, right?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case, we&#39;ll be seeing a lot of Celtic Servants this time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As far as I know from the legends, they all have a few screws loose. They&#39;re a bunch of airheaded Berserkers!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> What were those magical energy waves just now? Is there someone else with you?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Hey, are you keeping a fairy in your pocket or something? Nothing? Then, just where did that voice come from...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh. Is Graham Bell with you or something?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> If he were, the king would seriously lose his temper this time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hate to break it to you, but when it comes to long-distance communications, we&#39;re a few steps ahead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Apologies for introducing myself so late, Ms. Blavatsky. I&#39;m their navigator.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> My name is Dr. Roman. Make sure you don&#39;t forget it, as we may cross paths someday.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Wow...I can tell you&#39;re an imprudent man just by your voice. You&#39;re clearly up to no good, my dear.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey! Why does everyone always dis me when they first meet me?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, it doesn&#39;t matter. It means Fujimaru has an advisor as well.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> So, let&#39;s get back to the subject. You all get it now, right?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You can&#39;t win in this war unless you side with somebody. It will only get you killed if you try to take on both sides.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> This world maintains a precarious balance as the East and West continue to fight.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> If we didn&#39;t fight, this nation would have been completely destroyed and beyond salvation by now, you see?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> So both sides just like to fight?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Dear, you&#39;re not a good listener, are you? Has anyone called you stubborn before?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, at any rate, you should meet the king at least once...It&#39;ll be amusing.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So what are we, really?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh. I see. So I hadn&#39;t gotten around to explaining that yet. But...Heh heh.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> We&#39;ve already come this far, I don&#39;t want to ruin the surprise. Besides, isn&#39;t that more amusing?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amusing...you say?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Well, someone is calling himself “king” in this ultimate democratic nation. How is that not amusing?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Oh, if self-proclaimed title counts, I do remember there&#39;s an emperor as well.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You sure know a lot about snobs. If he were a Heroic Spirit, I&#39;m sure he would lament the current situation.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Ah, but first we have a preliminary show. Perfect. Can you help me out?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Pretty please♪</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s defend for now.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Either way, they&#39;re enemies we must eventually stand against.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, here I go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Here we are.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A fortress unfitting for America.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> The White House was taken over,so we had no choice.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> We built the fortress from the ground up. We should use anti-Celt measures to resist the Celts, right?</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Madam Blavatsky, Lord Karna. The presi-king awaits. Please come right away.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> M-Maybe I heard wrong. Did he just say “presi-king” or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, no doubt...I don&#39;t know how to say this, but it&#39;s so...simplistic.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Right? But that&#39;s what makes it charming. It&#39;s not an idea we&#39;d come up with.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Come, follow me. The king, despite his appearance, has a short temper.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...So your employer is just ahead, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nightingale, wait!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you itching that badly for a battle!?</p><hr><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Wait. That would be a bad move, Nightingale. Let your gun rest a while longer.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> If you want to cure this world&#39;s soldiers, identify the pathogen first. Or are you that simplistic as well?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...In the meantime, more soldiers die. Are you telling me to bear with that?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Yes. Bear with it, but do not get accustomed to it. It may be tough for you, but consider it a trial.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Or is long-term treatment not your policy? If so—</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I wonder which is beyond saving? You, or this land?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What? Are you saying my treatment is wrong?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Not quite. But everyone makes mistakes. Humans fall to ruin when convinced that their ideas are the only absolutes.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Anyway, if you idly meet your death here, that would be truly meaningless.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Everything has a proper order. Even if you temporarily defeat an enemy here, it may cause a greater evil to prosper.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –I see. I understand your valuable opinion. I will put the gun away for now.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Good grief. What a consummate liar. Blavatsky, I will keep an eye on her.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You look after this world&#39;s only Master and that Servant.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Yes yes, I know! Well then, let&#39;s get ourselves an audience with the king!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I&#39;ve brought them to see you, Mr. Presi-king.</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Understood. It will be another minute until the presi-king&#39;s arrival.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m starting to get nervous, Senpai. I wonder what kind of king he is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You might be right on that.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m detecting a new Servant approaching you,but there&#39;s something bizarre about it...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Umm...I wonder if this really is a Heroic Spirit?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Bizarre? In what way, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I don&#39;t want to affect your first impression with my speculation. Anyway, we&#39;ll talk after you meet this King.</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Thank you for waiting. The presi-king is here!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Oh! At last I get the chance to meet that angel!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> How I have yearned for this moment!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I intended on inviting them only after they eliminated the Celts, but this is fine, too!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Yes, advancing the schedule is a good thing! Much better than pushing back the deadline!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I see he still hasn&#39;t fixed his habit of talking to himself while walking. I was hoping he could at least have kept that to himself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That was “talking to himself? ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-Did you hear how loud he was, Senpai!? No human could do that!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> —To be frank, you have all done a fantastic job! Greetings, everyone! And congratulations!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Huh? Is the monitor broken? All I see on it is a creature?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll say it once more! All of you have done a fantastic job!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I bet you were pretty surprised. Right? Right? Right?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Well, yes, they&#39;d be surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-Well, I was indeed surprised...but it&#39;s fine, I&#39;m getting used to things of this sort...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That aside, umm...You must be the king who controls Western America, right?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Indeed, it is as you say.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I have taken it upon myself to rule America in order to pulverize those barbaric Celts—</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I am a Servant, and a gentleman who supports other Servants! I am Thomas Alva Edison, the presi-king!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> E!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> DI!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> SON of a gun!?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> —Oh, excuse me. I was at a complete loss for words.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Edison...Edison, the King of Inventions? It&#39;s really you? You&#39;re not a Chimera?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Indeed. Although I am currently the presi-king, not the King of Inventions.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> You must be Lady Florence Nightingale.... You are just as beautiful as they say...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Unfortunately we could not meet when we were alive, but this moment is truly a miracle of energy, no, a miracle of souls.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I was not one to live on the battlefield, but I deeply respect your convictions and rationality.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Do lend us your strength. Not only to advance medicine, but also to boost the morale of our soldiers—</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The effects of you as poster girl are immeasurable! Hahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I had no idea you were not human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> To put it lightly...He&#39;s a feline?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> To put it figuratively...From the Savanna?</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What? I am without a doubt a human!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Humans are just higher forms of beasts who possess reason and wisdom. They shall not be segregated by the color of their skin or the shape of their face.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even if I possess a lion&#39;s head,that fact does not change.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I am Edison, an intelligent human being. That is all.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Wow, just look how he asserts himself with confidence. I really need to learn that kind of positivity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Basically, he was a human when alive, but now his head is a lion when summoned as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, since that doesn&#39;t affect his intelligence in the slightest it&#39;s not a problem. This lion, he&#39;s the definition of rationalism!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor! Everyone was taking a hint and not calling him the “L” word!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, he can&#39;t help it. I mean, he&#39;s basically a lion.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A lion...I like the sound of that. Also, was that communication through magecraft?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even though you live in an age of telephones, your fixation with such an inconvenient method bewilders me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Mages by birth are indeed illogical creatures. Surely you can make better use of spiritual channels.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, what? Look, phone lines only work when you occupy the same space in time, yes?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This is far more functional, and crosses time and space in a kind of hyper-navigational form of communication...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh. So that means you do not exist in this era!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm. To be able to communicate across different eras is quite convenient indeed...hmm.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Magecraft and science are similar. There is nothing you can do that I cannot.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to see if the same thing can be done by telephone. No, wait, I should develop a spirit phone before that...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Yes, yes, Mr. Edison. Please save your inventions for later, okay?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Oh, yes. Right.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Your name is Fujimaru...was it? You are the only Master in this world.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let me get to the point. Can you lend us the strength that you used to correct the previous four eras to get rid of the Celts?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> How&#39;d you know that?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I am well aware. You see, a certain fellow took it upon himself to inform me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The world&#39;s worst good-for-nothing! That detestable hysteric told me...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> “While all these things happened, I am in good health. I bet you&#39;ve never had such grand adventures, Edison”</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Truly the epitome of displeasure!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> —Ahem. Well, so much for that. Anyway, we must get rid of these Celts.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why get rid of the Celts?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm. I believe that is a self-evident truth.</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Needless to say, the Celts are an anachronism in this age.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The United States is a cutting-edge nation created by capitalism and rationalism.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This is our nation, and home to those with intellect.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> However, they keep multiplying like planarians, and the American army lost due to difference in the size of our forces.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But fortunately, I, a Heroic Spirit, have descended upon this nation!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The battlefront revived with my proposals of a new national structure and reformed military, equalizing the situation.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmph—They truly are barbarians. Attempting to contend against me in mass production is the epitome of idiocy.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Eventually my mechanized infantry will cover the land and annihilate the loathsome Celts once and for all.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> However...there is one matter that concerns me.... Leaders. In other words, we don&#39;t have enough Servants.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We have an obedient army,but no mighty ace warrior to lead them.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> While enemy Celts have many notorious barbarians lined up.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Just when we gain a foothold somewhere,we end up losing it to a single Servant.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Only Servants can overcome other Servants. We only have three Servants on our side, including myself.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Other Servants who were summoned are in disarray,and show no interest in joining us.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Only my rationality restrains me from roaring out at this sad state of affairs.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The Heroic Spirits meant to save America dread the enemy and refuse to fight. Their negligence is going too far!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> This lion just roared!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re “rational,” right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> C-Calm down, Mr. President!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm...If you&#39;re trying to save the world, we are willing to cooperate with you...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh! You understand! Truly wonderful! You also have a very delicious-looking body!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Foou!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hey, stop hitting and biting me, runt! That was figurative. I&#39;d never assault a lady!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Can I ask you two questions?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes, what is it? Coming from an exemplary woman like yourself, I shall give you a genteel answer.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A gentleman&#39;s genteel reply— Oh, how elegant! Karna, please record that in the Presi-king Chronicles.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...My first question. On our way here, we saw the mechanized infantry several times...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Is that the result of your proposal? Is that what you aim for with your “new national structure? ”</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Indeed, that is correct! I arrived at this conclusion...in order to save the nation from its predicament!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> National unity! Citizens herded, no, rallied, to new life! Equal national service, regardless of age or gender!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Eventually, all citizens will be part of the mechanized infantry and defeat the Celts, the invaders.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, we must maintain our mass-production lines for this purpose.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Acquisition of labor from all across the land. Institution of 20-hour workdays. Unremitting surveillance.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, you need the best welfare system, too. One cannot have labor without recreation.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We will play three times as hard, work three times as hard, and win three times as hard as normal humans! That&#39;s my new vision for America!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Playing three times as hard doesn&#39;t sound too bad...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s not okay! Recreation has its limits! Please just be normal!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Is he not aware of human limitations?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I agree...Mr. Edison&#39;s plan does not take physical limitations into account whatsoever.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...So that is what you are fixated on.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm? What&#39;d you just say?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, I was just talking to myself. Do not mind me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Well then, my second question. How do you intend to save the world?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That can be accomplished by securing the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Defeat the Celts, obtain the Holy Grail, then correct the era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> While it is unclear who among the Celts possesses the Grail, if we can secure it, we can handle the rest...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No, it is unnecessary to correct this era.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It is unnecessary. If I acquire the Grail, I could refine it and we should be able to prevent the incineration of eras.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Consequently, it would give birth to a world named “America” operating on a different timeline from the other eras.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What...Is that really possible!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Having been summoned by the Grail, we Servants are well aware of its power. My conclusion is that it is quite possible.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What will happen to the other eras?</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –They will probably be destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Then, it&#39;s pointless to do so!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What? Is there any other idea as brilliant as this?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This America will survive for all eternity. My inventions will remake America.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It will show those Celts, who can only procreate and fight, that my inventions are the lights of humanity, the power of civilization!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...So you expand your battlefront for that purpose? Abandoning those who fell in battle.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...An accusation fit for Chief Nurse Nightingale, who so valiantly struggled for the salvation of all soldiers.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I...I am...ugh...not abandoning them because I want to, however—</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Edison, calm down. Florence is just stating her opinion. It&#39;s not an accusation.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;m aware of that. That just now was my usual headache. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Listen, Lady Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> To us...To me, especially, this nation is everything. And a true king has a paramount duty to protect his nation.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-But!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you are a Heroic Spirit, you should also have a duty...an ideal, a wish, to protect the world!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...You are right. Even my current self possesses that sense of duty in one corner of my sanity.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mr. Edison. If you deny that duty,you are nothing more than a mere patriot.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Quite so. What is wrong with a king being a patriot?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I see. In that case— There is only one thing for me to do!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Nightingale, that&#39;s enough. I will not allow you to fight here.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Even if that costs me my life.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Let go of me! I can tell! Leaders with those eyes always lead to destruction!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And in the end he will irresponsibly declare...That “it wasn&#39;t supposed to turn out like this! ”</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Fujimaru...Master. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t you join me to fight the Celts and acquire the Holy Grail? I&#39;ll give you three minutes to decide.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Maybe joining them for the time being is not a bad idea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you saying, Doctor!? He&#39;s opposed to the idea of fixing the Foundation of Humanity!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Quite the contrary, he&#39;s for it. It&#39;s just that the world he envisions differs from ours.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t have the time to confront him now. And in the end, I think he&#39;ll stop baring his fangs.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m not just being hopeful. My conclusion stems from historical observation...and experience.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Those that move nations believing in their own righteousness will experience consequences, in one form or another.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...But that&#39;s all irrelevant. Now is about gaining the upper hand in the war.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With all the Celtic Servants gathering,there is an overwhelming gap in military strength.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Diarmuid Ua Duibhne and Fionn mac Cumhaill are formidable enough. How many more Servants of that caliber do they have?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> For now, we will cooperate in order to acquire the Holy Grail, and correct the mistake where Celtic myths dominate North America.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What happens afterwards? We can think about that later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, what should we do? ...Senpai?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Well then. Have you come to a decision? Let&#39;s hear what you have to say.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this. I can&#39;t help.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Give up on the Holy Grail, President Lion.</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...That is an unexpected response indeed.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Whatever your hidden agenda may be, I thought you would agree to join forces.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I, Thomas Alva Edison, should respect your honesty and sincerity.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But as presi-king, unfortunately I have no choice but to condemn you.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Get &#39;em!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They&#39;re coming! Stand back, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hah, hah...No good, there&#39;s no end to them!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So even my prized mechanized infantry will become junk in minutes when going up against a Servant, huh?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But sometimes it&#39;s quantity over quality. You should be out of energy already.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –Blavatsky! Throw them inside the special underground jail!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. I guess it can&#39;t be helped. So sorry, but you&#39;re getting locked up.</p><h2 id="section-5-cool-hand-florence" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-5-cool-hand-florence" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 5: Cool Hand Florence</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Those numbers just aren&#39;t fair.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But even after all that, they let us keep all our equipment.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Fou is safe, too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not quite, Doctor. Just run an analysis and you&#39;ll know...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The magical energy supply from Master is being cut off. And we have no way of escaping this jail...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. You can&#39;t really underestimate a Caster from the 19th century, can you?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, since I&#39;ve lived on this continent before, my affinity with this land is not so bad.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Tell the guard if you&#39;re willing to cooperate. We&#39;ll let you out immediately.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...Tell me, Fujimaru. Why did you refuse?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> As the gentleman from Chaldea said,you could have just betrayed us along the way.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> At the very least, I&#39;m sure you saw this coming. Yet you chose this foolish path.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> For Edison&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I see. True, I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be hurt if you&#39;d betrayed him.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> In life, he was fed up by all the lawsuits. Despite the way he looks, he&#39;s naïve.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> He loves his country more than anyone and thinking that is only natural. No, he&#39;s obsessed. It&#39;s extreme self-righteous patriotism.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But if you understand that, why are you helping him, Helena? Wouldn&#39;t he listen to your counsel?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> No. My approach can&#39;t save this country.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> For better or worse,only Mr. Edison can stop the Celtic army.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I&#39;m with him for now. I do have obligations from when we were alive, too.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...However, Fujimaru,what you said makes me happy.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t hate him too much. As the King of Inventions, he really is an amusing person, like a child.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For Nightingale&#39;s sake.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> For my sake?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I can see that. After all, Florence would never agree to those conditions.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You never abandon someone once you&#39;ve become allies, huh?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> As a Master and a human being, that&#39;s wonderful.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Though other people may think it&#39;s foolish...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...your actions are noble, more so than anybody else.</p><hr><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> —Rest easy. Someone will come to your rescue soon.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Until then, just wait here.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We have to do something to get out of here. Please help me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I-I know, but I think it&#39;s impossible to destroy a cell with a gun!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, I think I&#39;ve managed to shave off a little bit. Come on, everyone pitch in and dig!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, the bullets are ricocheting inside this cell! Nightingale, that&#39;s too reckless–!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Yes, that was reckless.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> But on the bright side, the sound of the gunshots let me find you quickly.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, wait, a Servant you say? But I didn&#39;t detect anything at all!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> If I gave off a Servant response, we&#39;d risk the possibility of that great hero of India finding us.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s thanks to this Noble Phantasm that I borrowed from that man...Just a moment. I&#39;ll get you out of there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who on earth are you–?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> ...Good question. I&#39;m sure you can&#39;t trust me unless I tell you my name.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> That said, my True Name is not to be revealed lightly. Though even if I told you, you wouldn&#39;t know who I am.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> As such, you should just call me this. “Geronimo”...My name is Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Geronimo!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Apache shaman...You were summoned as a Caster, huh?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Strictly speaking, I&#39;m far from being a shaman. I&#39;m just a warrior.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The Hero of the Apache! ...I see. There&#39;s no way he would follow Edison.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even though they live in the same land...Or, no, that&#39;s actually why they&#39;re so incompatible.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Strictly speaking, we should also be enemies, but this is no time for that.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> There, you&#39;re free. Now you should be able to receive magical energy again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to escape...But first we need to take down the mechanized infantry guarding the place.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Karna will notice us at that point. It&#39;ll take everything you have to escape.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Are you ready?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s do it, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right—I&#39;m not used to bullets yet, but I&#39;ll do my best!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...All right! They&#39;re down! But Karna must have noticed. Follow me, quickly!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-This place is bigger than I thought!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In this era, land is the only thing there&#39;s plenty of.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Mr. Geronimo. Do you mind if I ask you something?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to raise your voice, mage. I can hear you. What is it?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In Eastern and Western America, the Celts and Edison have raised armies and are at war. This we understand.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> But do you know of any other Servants who we speculate were summoned as countermeasures?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes, there are three other...No, two other Servants that fight with me. I&#39;ll introduce you after we escape.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It seems there are many more Servants who have been summoned here to America, though.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...But we&#39;re short on military strength, so we had to act very carefully.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> To be honest, the Celtic army is picking us off one by one.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But if you join us, we&#39;ll be able to take decisive action.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Wait a moment. I have one question.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What is it, angel? ...I take that back. I was inappropriate. My apologies.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Go ahead.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If memory serves me correctly, Geronimo, you were once at war with this nation.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If this era is corrected, you will be treated as a warrior who failed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Is that still all right?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Victory or defeat, in the end, it&#39;s no more than a point embedded in the flow of time.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Crushing this era would mean that my brothers and I shed all this blood for nothing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s simple to pretend something doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s even easier if that something is disadvantageous to yourself.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even so, being able to acknowledge something is what makes us warriors. Only a sly coyote would pretend something doesn&#39;t exist.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Too much irony for my taste.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I see. Then for now, I can think of you as an ally, yes?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t want to try fooling a gaze that could even shoot a sun down. Ah, here&#39;s the exit—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...As expected. I&#39;m picking up one powerful Servant.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Outwitting him was too much to ask. But we can&#39;t turn back now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Push through!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> So it is you, Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t want to meet the great hero of the Mahabharata under these circumstances.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I did not wish to encounter the great man who bravely confronted a nation under these circumstances, either.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> However, I must raise my spear now that we&#39;re being attacked. Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t let the mechanized infantry interfere.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> This will be a battle just between me and all of you. –So, prepare to fight.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Listen, Fujimaru. It seems he doesn&#39;t expect this to be a battle to the death.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Normally, the odds would be against us, but now that he isn&#39;t going all out, we might still have a chance if we can send him flying.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> He&#39;s a Lancer. Summon Servants that are advantageous against him and unleash Noble Phantasms before he does. Got it?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;re ready. Then here I come!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Somehow we pushed him back! Master, now&#39;s the time!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s escape!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s retreat!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Now! Run, run–!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> This is as far as I go...Edison. It seems that the clock has started ticking.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You have asked me for help, so I&#39;ll stay until the end...But what can we do to avoid a catastrophe?</p><h2 id="section-6-rama-got-his-sword" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-6-rama-got-his-sword" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 6: Rama Got His Sword</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good morning, Senpai. Are you awake?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Good morning, Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That nap was exactly three hours. Rest when you can. That&#39;s the spirit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Where are we?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Geronimo said to take a nap since it&#39;s going to be a long journey, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Relax. This is a small town in the West. The residents have already evacuated, likely due to the Celts&#39; fierce attacks.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The only people on this land now are those who have come to our side.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> It&#39;s Geronimo!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Is he all right?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> The life force of Servants is incredible. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s fine, but he&#39;s breathing anyway.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s a Servant here?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes. Actually, we&#39;re sheltering the third Servant I mentioned here.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Of course I&#39;m helping you because I want your help in return, but most of all, it&#39;s to get him medical treatment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In other words, the spotlight is on me. Not like it matters...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If there&#39;s a patient who seeks treatment, I will tend to him.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes, please. In your care, he may yet have a chance.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> All right, bring him out!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Ungh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Horrible...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A part of his heart has been gouged out! I&#39;m shocked he&#39;s still alive!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Well...Endurance...is...my strong suit...Ugh...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –I&#39;ve never seen a wound like this before. But I can&#39;t turn you away.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, young man. Even if you end up in hell, I&#39;ll drag you out.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Hnngh...That does sound...promising!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Ah, owwww! C-Can&#39;t you be a little more gentle!?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Do you understand? My heart is crushed!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m surprised you can even talk.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ll heal you. First, your heart is about to lose all functionality.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Because of that, blood cannot circulate properly in your body...I must cut it out.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...All limbs, I mean. And if possible, I&#39;ll take all organs out except your lungs too!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> W-Wait, wait, wait!

There is no greater joy than being alive!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> As an individual life form who has taken root on this earth, you have a duty to survive, come what may!</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s easy for you to say!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s all right. I swear that I&#39;ll heal you...I swear it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So, who is he? He doesn&#39;t seem like a Servant from this country...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Y-You mean me? I am Rama! The great king of Kosala!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> For more details...Owowowowow! Read the Ramayana! That&#39;s all!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Aaaah, dammit! That really hurts!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Frustrating. Frustrating, frustrating, frustrating, frustrating!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No matter how much I slow down the speed of encroaching death, I cannot stop it!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, I won&#39;t give up. As long as this body is alive, I&#39;ll fulfill my duty!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah, Nightingale, be more gentle! Who were you fighting that could give you such a wound?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It was inevitable...After all, my opponent...was Cú Chulainn, Ireland&#39;s strongest hero.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Cú Chulainn!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahhh...Of course. If Celtic warriors are the enemy,then naturally he would be around...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Cú Chulainn...Ireland&#39;s most renowned hero, nicknamed the Child of Light.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They say if he aims his lance, Gáe Bolg,it always pierces his target&#39;s heart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I suppose it would be difficult to avoid that,even if you are the hero of the Ramayana.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...More like, it&#39;s a miracle you&#39;re still alive.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Preventing the collapse of our front lines is important, but I want to heal Rama.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> When I heard about a Servant concentrating on healing soldiers, I brought you here— Hmmm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That voice...from the sky.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Tch. Scouts. I&#39;ll wipe out every last one of them.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I have a favor to ask of you all. At this rate, the boy&#39;s condition isn&#39;t going to improve.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> His heart should&#39;ve been repaired just now, but more than 10% of it is starting to deteriorate again.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> A bottomless bucket...Well, not that bad, but without continuous treatment he will die quickly.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This is completely due to my own incompetence.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> However, I do not want to give up on him. I will not give up on him.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This boy wants to live so badly.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> As long as he possesses the will to live, I will never give up on him!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Tell me how to do this. How to treat him. Tell me that which I do not know!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Doctor. Please give us your analysis concerning Rama&#39;s injury.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. You don&#39;t need to send me any detailed data. I can tell at a glance. It&#39;s a curse.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Removing the curse takes precedence over treatment. The fastest way is to defeat the person who injured him.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Gáe Bolg is said to be a demonic spear or technique wielded by Cú Chulainn—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any case, there&#39;s no doubt that it was a blow that, if left untended, will destroy the heart.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s basically a miracle that Rama is still alive. Normally, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see him already dead...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Or rather, it&#39;s strange he&#39;s not dead.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Then again, this is Rama, hero of the Ramayana, one of India&#39;s two epic poems. If anybody can perform a miracle, it&#39;s him.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Indeed. You should praise me even more...Ouch.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s more accurate to say that Rama reversed his state of death through sheer willpower.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Basically, the fact that Rama is alive is an “error” in the proper cause-and-effect flow of this world.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Doctor Roman, please correct yourself. I do not think it is an error that he is alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Take your finger off that trigger! Please, just hear what I have to say!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As I said earlier, the only way to save him is to eliminate the spear that can distort cause and effect.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However–I can tell how difficult that is even by monitoring events from over here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Besides Cú Chulainn, it&#39;s certain that there are at least two more Servants.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Exactly. This is quite literally a war that we are in.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Were I to stage a one-man attack, only death would greet me. Ugh...I&#39;m sorry, please continue your treatment!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You don&#39;t need to tell me. Please sit still.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, we do have one thing in our favor. This world&#39;s state is unstable.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just like how the Celtic warriors continue to be summoned and fight to the death despite their precarious existences...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we can somehow strengthen Rama&#39;s existence, we can remove the distortion cast on him, or close to it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Is that similar to how we broke Siegfried&#39;s curse when we were in France?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Yeah. The best thing would be to make contact with a Servant who knew him when he was alive.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Knowing the “blueprint” of his body when he was alive will likely increase the efficacy of Ms. Nightingale&#39;s treatment.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...I know someone. A Servant that meets your criteria exists in this world.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Who, exactly?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ah, hmm. It&#39;s embarrassing to say, but...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...You can&#39;t mean Eli</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, stop! Loose lips sink ships, as they say.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you utter that name in a place like this, there is no doubt she will be summoned.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Kyuu, foou.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Huh...Eli? Unfortunately, you are quite off the mark.</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Another was summoned from the same era as me—my wife, Sita.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I have not seen her yet, but I am certain that she is being held captive somewhere in this world.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I crossed blades with Cú Chulainn in order to find her location.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I see. Your wife, Sita. You may have dragged her here when you were summoned.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If we find her, it may be possible to cure you.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I see. At present, Rama is unquestionably the strongest among the Servants who have been summoned.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> At full strength, he would likely be an equal match for Karna.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I want to save him if I can. We must locate his wife Sita as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> For that purpose, I would like Nightingale to accompany me–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Hm? I&#39;d go with you to the ends of the earth. Got a problem?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Truly!? I feel reassured, but you don&#39;t need the details!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Why must I abandon my patient? Especially if there is no one besides me who can save him.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> With that in mind...I believe it is worth seeking a somewhat more effective nursing method.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Rama, please excuse me. Don&#39;t struggle too much.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Wh-What!? You can carry me so easily!? This is how I used to carry Sita!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Isn&#39;t that how you carry a princess?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hey, put me down! What am I to do if my people witness me in this state!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I do not mind. I am used to violent patients. This way, please. We must also prepare a special belt.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Let me go! Let! Me! Go!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Oh, uh...That was quick. You are truly the angel feared...uh, I mean, adored by all soldiers.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What&#39;s wrong, Doctor? You seem disheartened...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s nothing...I mean, Rama is still young, right? Yet he has a wife...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> And you&#39;re still single at thirty, eh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yet you&#39;re still single at thirty...</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I can&#39;t read your expression, Fujimaru! Are you sympathizing with me or laughing at me?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ? That is true, but I think it&#39;s strange for the Doctor to feel inferior.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Shouldn&#39;t he feel inferior?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> N-No, I mean— I believe the Doctor has, uh, been married previously...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whaaaaaaaaaat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When did that happen!?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> What? Mash, why did you have to blurt out something like that!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But it&#39;s true. This one time I saw the Doctor washing his hands and there was a—</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ahem. Sorry, but can we get back to the subject? We&#39;re quite pressed for time, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh...that&#39;s right. I apologize. Please continue.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Besides healing Rama, we also need to figure out how to deal with Edison and the Celtic soldiers.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I suppose Mr. Mage in the other world has some kind of plan in mind?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Of course. While Fujimaru is on the front lines, my job is to collect data and analyze it.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Recall earlier when we–or Mash Kyrielight, rather, fought with Fionn mac Cumhaill.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He muttered something that bothered me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> “They&#39;re monsters born indefinitely from our queen. Even if we lose a few thousand here, it won&#39;t be a problem for us! ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In other words...the Celtic soldiers may be able to multiply infinitely.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If that&#39;s true, normal attacks are useless. Reducing their numbers won&#39;t work as a strategy.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...That did briefly cross my mind. But it&#39;s overwhelming to hear someone say it outright.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Does Edison&#39;s mechanized infantry follow the same principle?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s probably fair to say so.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The only way to counter Celtic soldiers, who wouldn&#39;t flinch at the loss of thousands, is through mass production.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As an inventor, Edison did not try to pioneer anything—</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> His talent lay in modifying other people&#39;s cutting-edge inventions so that they became more accessible.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Without Edison, the telephone, the light bulb, and many other so-called “modern conveniences”...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...would have developed at an unimaginably sluggish pace.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Moreover, America&#39;s pride is its ability to develop war-machines on a massive scale.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see. Perhaps it&#39;s natural for the King of Inventions to call himself this nation&#39;s king.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> However, it&#39;s a troubling idea for us mages: mass production will lower the value of all Mystics.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> At any rate, there&#39;s only one course of action I can recommend.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Assassination– Use Servants to take out both the king and queen at the same time.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Facing them head-on and wasting our resources is exactly what they want.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> With an enemy that can multiply troops indefinitely, the only solution is to target their leader!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> —Exactly. Well put, Doctor.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You must be quite a famous mage. Your voice alone seems unreliable, but that intelligence is anything but.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Even Geronimo has to point that out...I wonder just what&#39;s wrong with my image...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me, Doctor. Fou just said, “Geronimo hit the nail on the head. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hey, I&#39;m well aware that I&#39;m kind of a wimp, okay!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...All right. To make sure this assassination succeeds,let&#39;s unite all the Servants scattered in different areas.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Once we come together, we will make a stand against the Celtic soldiers and Edison.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We need to make sure to return this land to the hands of its people!</p><h2 id="section-7-young-guns" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-7-young-guns" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 7: Young Guns</h2><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Sorry to do this while we walk,but let me explain the situation again.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I have confirmed the presence of two Servants, both Archers. You&#39;ll have to ask them for their True Names.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Both are infamous Servants who specialize in guerrilla warfare.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Unless they run into a particularly powerful enemy, they are unlikely to lose in combat.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But they&#39;re at a big disadvantage in terms of numbers.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even though these Archers excel at guerrilla warfare, the best they can achieve is reducing the extent of the damage.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Celtic soldiers are laying waste to the land as they please. Such savagery is easy to identify.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Savagery...As they please...Are they not all united in one group?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Not objectively speaking. But, it&#39;s obvious that their purpose is seizing control of this land.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So they probably have one objective, but how they accomplish that is left up to each individual.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The literature suggests that Celtic soldiers can be downright vicious and ferocious.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Indeed.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> As far as I saw, Cú Chulainn massacred all opposing soldiers.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> His nickname is “Child of Light? ” What a joke. He&#39;s truly fallen into darkness already...Ugh!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> By the way, what happened to you, Rama?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Rama, why are you being carried like that?</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This wasn&#39;t my idea! It was this iron-like nurse who...ugh!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Fujimaru. Please try not to disturb the patient.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This is an emergency transportation device I devised. It&#39;s not a mere body bag. It&#39;s a Rama bag.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> U-Ugh...To be carted around by a woman...How humiliating.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Gender and age are irrelevant for patients. Do not forget that you have a severe injury and cannot walk.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> —Well.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The Western American army forces civilians into factories, making them work on the mechanized infantry&#39;s mass production.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wow. Edison has become a dictator.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I heard many have sought refuge for the time being, saying it&#39;s better than being slain by the Celts.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The war between the East and the West is at a stalemate. While it&#39;s a relief that we don&#39;t need to worry about the civilians at this stage...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Wait, hide!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Looks like scouts. If we let even one escape, they&#39;ll call reinforcements.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Understood. I shall hurry to cut off their escape route...huh?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Umm, Master. What happened to Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Hmm. She has already pounced on the scouts with a vengeance.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I shall purify the source of the illness! Time for your medical exam. Now, open your chest for me!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> W-Wait!? Do you intend to fight while still carrying me!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Wait, hey, my wound...Argh, that hurts!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> M-Master, I will be right back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Annihilation complete. Excellent work, hygienically speaking.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, Nightingale?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We planned to surround the enemies before battle, so if you rush in on your own, it causes us trouble...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> And don&#39;t go off fighting with me on your back...I&#39;m your patient, remember...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Healing my patients is always my top priority. All other matters are not my concern.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai. Senpai. Nightingale won&#39;t listen to us.</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fofooou...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru. It&#39;d be nice if you did something about this...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But she&#39;s a Berserker.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But she&#39;s Nightingale.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right...I&#39;m beginning to realize that a conviction so strong you can&#39;t compromise is a type of Madness Enhancement too...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes. Whether she&#39;s like this after becoming a Servant, or if she was like this in life is rather scary to contemplate...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Luckily, we may reach our destination before that.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Two Archers are in the town ahead. Considering the earlier scout, they&#39;re most certainly under attack.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s just as he said, Fujimaru. I&#39;ve confirmed the presence of multiple enemies and Servants.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> They seem to be surrounding the town. Hurry!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Let&#39;s get going, Senpai!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh? Where&#39;s Nightingale?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...She&#39;s gone. On top of that,Rama, who she was carrying on her back, is gone too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> L-Let&#39;s run!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Huh? Did you hear something just now?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hmm...It sounds like people fighting, or something. Have our reinforcements arrived?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> The tables have turned! Old Man Geronimo&#39;s finally done it!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> ...Hey, hey, Green?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Remind me. Is Geronimo a woman with a medical bag, toting a gun and carrying a kid on her back?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> ...Huh? What&#39;s that scary-sounding thing? Not even our banshee is that scary.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Why, you...You didn&#39;t listen to a word of what the others were saying, did you?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, I did! That good hygiene is the basis of all healing! So I shall now disinfect them all at full power!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You&#39;re such a...Argh! You...Mash! Fujimaru! Hurry up and rescue me already!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A-Anyway, in this situation,there&#39;s only one thing we can do.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We need to protect Nightingale!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Leave the cover fire to me! Go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> All right! Mash Kyrielight–going in!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Do not interfere with my treatment!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> How should I say it...This is ridiculous...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hey, hey! Hey, you! You&#39;re an ally, right? I think?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Are you one of the Archers Geronimo was talking about?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Oh, good. So you ARE an ally! Hey, Green! They&#39;re allies!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> That&#39;s good to hear. Really good.</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Most of the enemies are gone now, but I was afraid we&#39;d have to go against that scary lady next.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Oh, how long have you been there?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s my skill, don&#39;t worry about it. As for me, I&#39;m more interested in the fact that you&#39;re being carried on her back.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> –Please, just don&#39;t ask. It&#39;s an excessively long and convoluted story.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hey, hey! Are those people charging at us our allies too?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yes. They are very reliable allies.... At least more than myself right now!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Most of the Celtic warriors have been eliminated–</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;m picking up a strong enemy response! It&#39;s a big one...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not another dragon, is it!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No. This–is a new type of demonic beast. Please be cautious!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Oh, seeing animals here. Just how unsanitary can this place get!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And there&#39;re so many different kinds...A true hotbed of bacteria. I&#39;ll get triple the disinfectant ready!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I see, so that&#39;s the first thought in your mind seeing this? You&#39;re amazing, Nightingale!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> –Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We won! But for some reason...I feel more exhausted than usual...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you all right, Nightingale? Let me treat your wounds–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I am a nurse, I understand my body more than anyone. I can still move. Wounds like these will heal themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> But you&#39;re bleeding.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What of it? On the battlefield my blood is as precious as their blood.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If shedding my own blood spares others from spilling their own, I will gladly do so.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> As someone who&#39;s joined the military, that&#39;s the only mission possible for me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What should we do, Senpai?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hey, are you the reinforcements Geronimo mentioned?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-Yes. You must be the ones he spoke about...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Yep, the pair in a solitary struggle. My True Name is...I&#39;ll just tell you, since it&#39;s too troublesome otherwise.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m Robin Hood, Archer class. And this guy with me here is–</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> What the heck? You just blurted it out? No fair. Then I guess there&#39;s no reason I should keep mine a secret.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m William Henry McCarty, Jr. Though people call me–Billy the Kid!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> To protect this nation, it looks like I, a Servant from this nation, was chosen.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I&#39;m an Archer, of course. Nice to meet you!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad both of you are alive and well.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is the Demi-Servant, Mash Kyrielight, and this is her Master, Fujimaru.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice to meet you.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yes, good to meet you. Well, at least we&#39;re not fighting all on our own anymore now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Just you two?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> There are some townsfolk who couldn&#39;t evacuate. They&#39;re injured.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that&#39;s why Nightingale rushed off like that...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Just like a coyote catching the scent of blood.... Maybe that metaphor was a bit rude.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> They&#39;re quite weakened, but their lives aren&#39;t in danger.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Thank goodness!</p><hr><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> So, um– Fujimaru? What should we do now?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Right, let me explain our current situation.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...Ah, okay. Heal this Rama kid, find more firepower for our party, and—</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Assassinate the enemy leader. That works, doesn&#39;t it? Sounds like an appropriate course of action.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> As expected of someone who&#39;s been fighting as the Faceless King, you really don&#39;t hesitate.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Both of us are used to doing dirty jobs. Right, Boy Outlaw King?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Ah, ha, ha! Well, of course! I&#39;m not gonna deal with guys that spawn infinitely.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Considering our lopsided class distribution,we could really use a Saber or Lancer in our lineup.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Having only Mash on the front line leaves our formation unreliable...Especially when Nightingale runs off on her own.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The ideal Servant would be someone summoned to this era who has no connection to the Celts...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think anyone I know has been summoned.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What is lacking the most in this world are nurses. Second to that are doctors.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> –Oof. I&#39;m not picking up any Servant responses in the vicinity.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If you can wait a bit, I&#39;ll expand the scan range.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Until we detect a Servant,I guess we have to patiently keep scouting the area?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Something wrong?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What&#39;s up?</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, just...I guess, um, before I teamed up with this guy, I met some...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> A Saber and a Lancer. Well...I mean, they were a Saber and a Lancer, but...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They&#39;re, like, ultra-problematic children?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Huh? Do they have Madness Enhancement? Or are they Anti-Heroes?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> One&#39;s definitely an Anti-Hero. But you can communicate with both of them.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But they were, I guess you&#39;d say...Well, you&#39;ll see when you meet them.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Just don&#39;t blame me when you do, okay?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> With our current situation, no matter how problematic the Servant is, we could use their aid.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When things get dire, Senpai will be able to unite us. Right, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll figure something out.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s make sure things don&#39;t get dire.</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s reassuring. You&#39;ve fought beside some pretty troublesome folks, huh?</p><h2 id="section-8-my-fair-lady" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-8-my-fair-lady" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 8: My Fair Lady</h2><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, really?

Except for your body, you&#39;re the worst woman ever. However, you do have a sharp eye for good men!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, how will they react? We&#39;re up against Rama and Geronimo, right?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And that one group.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Do they have a strong sense of purpose? Of duty? Or no reason at all? ...At any rate, what a nuisance.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Cú, you&#39;ve changed so much. You&#39;ve become more regal.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m still my old self. Everybody has moments when they&#39;re not so eager to fight.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how I&#39;m feeling at the moment.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I suppose. The animalistic side of you lusts for fulfilling battles and love.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> And the empty, hollow side of you is bored of battle, and just stoically deals with things.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> When summoned as a Servant,which side manifests is a matter of chance.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Admittedly, you&#39;re basically one of my creations. I&#39;m quite astounded at our compatibility.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> To be sure, I love both sides of you, Cú. I love you– Really, truly.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Shut up. You&#39;re annoying.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –You&#39;re so spiteful. Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That aside, half of Eastern America has already fallen.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> We&#39;ve killed George Washington and exterminated the majority of the nation&#39;s leaders.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I thought the battle was won. Who would&#39;ve known that the West would unite to oppose us?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> “Edison,” was it? I didn&#39;t expect a mere human to go this far.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The worst thing is that they have Karna on their side.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Fool. I told you to mow them down while they were still weak.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Look, I didn&#39;t think a mere “King of Inventions” would go this far!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I can&#39;t shake the feeling that he has some kind of backing. Something besides the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Otherwise, it&#39;s impossible to explain how he can oppose us as much as he has.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Hmm. That&#39;s alarming.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ll go and deal with him in time. Make sure our preparations are in order.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, of course.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, Cú. Let&#39;s dream together. A dream as pleasant as a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> When we awake, I&#39;m sure things will have moved forward. Hopefully it will be something to celebrate– Hehehe.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Ugh, I&#39;m so depressed. Completely run-down.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Why do I have to travel to America&#39;s remote regions just to see those guys...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ? What is holding you back? Did you meet them when you were alive?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Of course not. I never met such an overwhelming group when I was human.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> But it still feels like we&#39;re inextricably linked. Like we&#39;re connected, but still apart, you know?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ex-girlfriend?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Girlfriend?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, I see. So that was the reason. Robin, I underestimated you.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru...Don&#39;t pull such scary stuff out of that imagination of yours.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> But that&#39;s what it sounded like he was talking about. Don&#39;t you all agree?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Who cares?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...I am ignorant of such matters. I am dedicated to my wife, Sita.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What? A “girlfriend”...Is that the name of a new antibiotic?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Oh, this is pointless! Nobody here has a sense of humor!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I think they settled down around here...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Whoa. I&#39;m getting enemy readings, so watch out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay. Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Wait. Huh?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Don&#39;t these guys seem kind of weak? Well, whatever. I guess that&#39;s good for us.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Okay, let&#39;s do this!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> They&#39;re weak, but there are so many of them. I wonder why they&#39;re so weak.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Is it, maybe? No, there&#39;s no way...there&#39;s no way.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is something wrong?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;s nothing. Let&#39;s get on with this. We&#39;re not finished here yet.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Yup, they were weak!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But they&#39;re the same Celtic soldiers we&#39;ve been fighting, right? Seems like they fought something else before us–</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Hmm?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Geronimo, what&#39;s wrong?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> No, I just heard a weird sound–</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re right. What is that...exactly?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Each individual sound is beautiful, but when you put them together, they feel murky, like mud...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> It&#39;s like when you use red, blue, yellow, green, and pink paint...and the canvas goes all black.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please wait, Master. I feel like we&#39;ve heard this song somewhere.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It&#39;s just your imagination-tion-tion!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s an auditory illusion-sion-sion!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, the way you are ending your sentences is very strange!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ugh. Is she still singing...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ♪My heart is prickling...Romance in a box♪A little girl&#39;s iron maiden!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ♪You&#39;re so cute I&#39;ll lock you up♪ Shower you with bloody kisses and skewer you like kebabs!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ♪Don&#39;t fool around!

I should have ended that “okay” on a much springier, livelier note. Definitely.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Then I&#39;d do a cute little spin, and slap my tail at the audience.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s so fun to practice! I feel like I&#39;m just getting more and more charming! It&#39;s great!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If I say so myself, it&#39;s scary how perfect I am...Adding all these practices on top of my natural talent...I am entering godhood!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Heh heh, just you wait, Saber. Next time we meet, I&#39;ll be way different!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Excuse me, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I believe the situation calls for you to say something that should be said.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why me?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. There is only one thing to say. Senpai, I have faith in you. You can do it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay— Go ahead!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you embarrassed showing up so many times?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you embarrassed showing up so many times?</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? Who has the nerve to hurl slander at an idol?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, I didn&#39;t ask to be summoned, okay!? I mean, who wouldn&#39;t want a wonderful world tour anyway!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Well, if it isn&#39;t the [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] and Friends!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? Oh, the green mouse is also with you. What do you want?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t remember people by color! ...So, you&#39;re still singing here, I see.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> YES.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I mean, this is the ultimate entertainment hell where all the pigs filled with desire gather, and its name is–</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Broadway!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Broadway?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What, you&#39;ve never heard of it? It&#39;s the home of musicals! Oh, the glory of Broadway!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s a glittering hub of entertainment! A sparkling paradise for artistic expression...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, this place is just a hillbilly town at the moment. It is none other than I who deemed it Broadway!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> So here and there are the only places in America that are worth anything. Hehe, I can see it now.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> All the pigs enchanted by my singing voice flock around me here, one after another–</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Eventually I&#39;ll have everything built here. My own stage, my own theater, my own cinema.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;ll reign over it all as an unscalable magical tower! The only other thing I need is...Right, a statue of me!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> A super statue, 500 meters tall,faithfully capturing my exquisite beauty!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> As the goddess of fresh blood, I&#39;ll raise my voice in song with a tomato in one hand and end the cutthroat world of idols!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...Could someone stop her? Please?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, don&#39;t look at me like that! I don&#39;t want to! Look, uh, everyone has the right to dream!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hahaha. Delusions aren&#39;t dreams, and with how she is now, her dreams won&#39;t come true even after a century passes.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Treating damaged vocal cords is one thing,but curing delusions is beyond my expertise.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? ...I am very sorry, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> My mind wandered off for a moment there. Elisabeth, this is our third meeting!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you&#39;ll allow me to be frank, I believe your only audience is Celtic soldiers eager to pounce on you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Your beautiful voice won&#39;t reach their hearts. They hear only the death throes of a hungry dragon!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Huh?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Oh, I finally get it. Why those guys we ran into earlier were so weak.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You do? Me, too!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I get it, too.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I was getting so fired up because so many fans wanted to get near me...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Is it true that those half-naked macho men were just a bunch of fools incapable of understanding my art?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Correct! Those fellows would be quite out of place on your stage.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As a fan, my advice to you is to unleash your song at the right place and time!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> In order to promote your art(istically atrocious singing), I humbly beseech you to lend us your strength!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Nice job, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> ...Oh, so that&#39;s your plan...</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> –I see. I don&#39;t really get it, but I&#39;m convinced.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Basically, you need my power, right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh...Well, I can&#39;t say “no” when a passionate fan asks me to do something.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You&#39;ve passed, Mash! I, Elisabeth Báthory, henceforth pledge my microphone to your Master!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Thank you so much!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...I see. So that&#39;s how you&#39;re supposed to talk to that dumb dragon...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I had a feeling she loved to be flattered. But there&#39;s no way I could so desperately beg her for anything.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We are Servants. Thus, once we achieve our goal, we have no choice but to return to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...In the end, will she really have enough time to build her own Broadway?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That is to remain unsaid, Old Man Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> So, where&#39;s the next one?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We&#39;re going to pass through the eastern forest. Saber&#39;s in the town on the other side.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Another...Saber?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Right, Saber. An equal match for our Lancer here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Umm...are you perhaps referring to the “red” one?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ? You can tell your Sabers apart based on whether they&#39;re red or blue?</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I see, I see. Basically you&#39;re recruiting other members for me. I&#39;m your vocalist, so...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;ve got it! An assistant director, right? Lighting, seating, acoustics! Yup, those are important!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, Mash, Fujimaru. I meant to say this earlier, but thanks for what you did for me in France!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not at all. It is we who should extend our gratitude...Thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Saber class is an indispensable part of the group. Let&#39;s go.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ah! What&#39;s up with this forest? It&#39;s so big! I&#39;m scared!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The giant sequoias in the West are supposedly even larger.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> They&#39;re worth seeing once. If you&#39;re ever in Sierra Nevada, be sure not to miss them.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wow. America&#39;s forests are amazing.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yeah, these forests are still pristine.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There are animals resembling gorillas, too.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Right. Those gorilla-like things...Um, where?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Over there. See. There&#39;s one waving at us. It&#39;s holding a glow stick, no doubt.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not a gorilla, it&#39;s a werewolf-type enemy. And it&#39;s holding a club.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-P-Prepare for battle! It was clearly trying to ambush us!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s just an enemy? That&#39;s too bad. Let&#39;s finish this up quickly!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I worked up a little sweat. My [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet], give me something to wipe the sweat off.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Here, use this...</p><hr><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, wait! It&#39;s not right to use my Noble Phantasm as a towel!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Master, don&#39;t get carried away and try to snatch anything from me either!</p><h2 id="section-9-a-star-is-born" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-9-a-star-is-born" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 9: A Star Is Born</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have emerged from the forest. Robin, is that the town you told us about?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.... Hmm? Somebody&#39;s here.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s an ally.</p><p><strong>Spy:</strong><br> Geronimo. I have news.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hmm...I see. I&#39;m sorry, but please continue your investigation.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Who were those guys?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They&#39;ve been tracking the Celtic soldiers for me. In particular, I want to know where they&#39;re coming from.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Once we get that Saber on our side,we can pursue the matter further.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ugh, I don&#39;t want to do this...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ♪Hum, hum, hum, hum...Okay then, the groundwork is in place.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> It&#39;s a shame that a Western is the only thing you can shoot in a town like this–</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> But not to worry. Even in a Western, my extraordinary acting talent will no doubt win me an Academy Award!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be concurrently responsible for production, direction, the script, music, and the leading role...</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Oh, no! I just realized there&#39;s no cameraman–!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Hmph, what am I to do...Perhaps the time has finally come for me to try my hand at summoning?</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> But my profound talent may result in summoning a big shot...I&#39;ll be forced to choose between Eastwood and Scott...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hmm. Hollywood, is it? One must not underestimate the creative minds of Servants.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Hmph, who are you? I&#39;m quite busy, so off with you...Unless you&#39;re a cameraman.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Do excuse me. My name is Fergus. I once earned my keep as a Knight of the Red Branch.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Normally, I would have happily called myself a cameraman in order to hit on you–but things are complicated now.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Oh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> So I&#39;m going to kill you. Period. If you want someone to resent, you have only me.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I&#39;m doing this entirely for myself, after all. I&#39;ll cut you down just because I want to.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> Hmph. You seem to have your reasons, but I won&#39;t ask. You&#39;re quite bold to think you can kill me.</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mean to boast, but I, Nero Claudius, am not a petty Servant who will die so easily, you see?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Nero, the tyrant of ancient Rome! What an unusual Servant to run into.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> No wonder your radiance is different from that mediocre rabble. Such a swelling. A swelling similar to a waterfall.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Mediocre...rabble?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Indeed. On my way here,I cut down three other Servants.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> So you&#39;ll be my fourth victim.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Oh. Very impressive.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> But unfortunately, O mighty Fergus mac Róich, you&#39;re quite mistaken.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> The fourth victim...will be YOU!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> –I see. So I guess you aren&#39;t just an emperor that orders people about from your throne.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> How delightful. I guess there was no need to bring them...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Very well then. I&#39;m Fergus, of the Saber class. I&#39;ll face you as one of the queen&#39;s knights.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You know, what you&#39;re most mistaken about is your destiny. You are truly unlucky.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> –You&#39;re here, right? Faceless King!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Ugh!!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Who&#39;s there?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. I&#39;ll just come on out now.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey there, little emperor. I&#39;m impressed you knew I was here.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Call it my sixth sense. I&#39;m quite attuned to the presence of spectators.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yup, yup. Nothing less from a tyrant always seeking love. Anyway, I&#39;m not the only one who came running here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nero!?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmm, that voice...I feel like I have heard it somewhere before...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s right...You were still alive, back in Rome.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ahem. Your Majesty, Nero Claudius. I am Mash Kyrielight.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please accept our humble assistance.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, we owe you for your help in Rome!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Grant us the glory of fighting by your side one more time!</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Oh? So we have met somewhere before. You have earned my trust.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Anyway, both of you are my type! What beautiful faces!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You may have the honor of standing beside me! Pleased to meet you, strangers from my past!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Hehe. Master. Nero is just the same, isn&#39;t she?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Hmm. I suppose it is reckless to take on so many.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It would save us a lot of trouble if you would just surrender.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> –Surely, you jest.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I also shall borrow the power of my queen! Come out, brave soldiers!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Tch, so they were hiding.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> One against seven is a bit tough, but a hundred against seven should be more even.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh great...Looks like I can&#39;t slack off here.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I do not pardon laziness, mouse. If you wish to serve me, fight for your life.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Got it. Well then– Guess it&#39;s time to perform my role as an ally of justice!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s checkmate, General Muscles.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> General...Hah, general, you say? Sorry, but I&#39;m no general.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> My role is to simply add a little flair to the queen&#39;s legend.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> I only wished to become her equal in the world this time...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> W-Wait, Fergus! Do you know of my bride, Sita?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> The wife of a man named Rama, by the name of Sita!</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Your bride? I don&#39;t know if she was your bride, but I&#39;ve seen a young woman of similar appearance to you.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Where!?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> ...Hmph, very well. That was the one thing I found unpleasant in the queen&#39;s strategy, after all.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Return to the West, Rama. To Alcatraz Island. Your bride may be there.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Did you say...Alcatraz Island?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait, the famous prison island, said to be impossible to escape!?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> It&#39;s your choice whether to trust me or not.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No...I will. I&#39;ll believe you, Fergus mac Róich.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;ll head to Alcatraz Island.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Heroes of India gaze at other people with such pure, beautiful eyes...</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> Still, good grief–</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> There are so many splendid women here besides the queen.</p><p><strong>Fergus:</strong><br> What a waste, to die at a time like this...Ahahaha!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...A Celtic warrior who can admire beauty? That man Fergus had such fine taste!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> No, I think it&#39;s just that he doesn&#39;t have any standards at all...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm? Did you say something?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh, nothing. Anyway, what are you doing in an abandoned city like this, Your Majesty?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You can&#39;t tell? ...Well, I suppose I can&#39;t blame you.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hehehe, I know. I&#39;ve got it! This is a plan only a woman with an appreciation for art and beauty could come up with!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> We meet again, Saber! It must be fate that we were both summoned to America.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I can hear Mount János whispering to settle things here. To see who has the greater talent!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Oh? ...I thought I sensed something tingling. It must have been you, the devilish singing diva, Elisabeth!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hehehe. Things must be made clear to you, above all others. Listen well. In fact, everyone should listen...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> To my grand plan which is as profound as the deepest abyss!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve already got an idea. Well, go right ahead, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Very well, I shall! Here, I plan to build the city of ultimate fantasy, namely...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hollywood! That world-renowned palace of amusement!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whaaaaaat!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whaaaaaat.</p><hr><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Yes, such a pleasant reaction, thank you! I see you&#39;re a top class Master!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh...To think you&#39;ve taken one of the two greatest locations in America...Though admittedly I&#39;ve already taken the other one...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I knew it, Saber...You and I are tied by bonds of true friendship!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> We&#39;re rivals! And friends who appreciate the same art!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s just like we expected, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Heroes are amusing, aren&#39;t they, Geronimo?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I feel like I understand why the Roman Empire collapsed now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Treating someone&#39;s aesthetic sense is outside of my field.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Do you intend to help me with my plan? I could even promote you to sub-heroine, Mash!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Thank you very much. It&#39;s an honor to be the sub-heroine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...However, Nero. Or should I say, Your Majesty. There&#39;s just one problem with your plan.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm? What on earth could be the flaw in my perfect plan?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This nation is currently in the middle of a war due to these Celtic warriors.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As it is now, you won&#39;t find any cameramen–or even an audience!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> (Yup. I know that all too well. I knew that all along! )</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> N-No wonder a single person hasn&#39;t appeared to listen to my rehearsals!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> There&#39;s a saying in the Orient: “Amusement is only amusing when you have a livelihood. ”</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Well, it might have been a little different...But close enough.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Very well! In that case, I must make a stand as well! To build a golden city of movies in this land!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Elisabeth, our showdown is on hold. For now, we need to mop up the Celtic warriors in this country!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;d expect no less from my rival! I won&#39;t lose!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Leave the ticket sales to me! I&#39;ll force it on them after they&#39;re defeated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What a beautiful friendship.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, beautiful...As long as we don&#39;t get wrapped up in it.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Anyway, this means Saber&#39;s our ally now. We even took down Fergus as a bonus.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Let&#39;s consider this to be a good omen.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Excuse me, there&#39;s a transmission from the Doctor. Yes, Doctor?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry for interrupting your fun. If you head a little west from your location, you&#39;ll find a point with a strong Leyline.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;d like you to establish a circle and set up a summoning point as usual.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Everyone, I&#39;m sorry, but there&#39;s a place we&#39;d like to go.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But the patient...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ah, don&#39;t worry about that. Once the summoning point is established, we can supply healing spells.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Using that, you can hold out for a while. Securing camp is vital, for Rama&#39;s sake as well.</p><h2 id="section-10-ambivalent-states" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-10-ambivalent-states" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 10: Ambivalent States</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> As usual, it seems enemies are gathering at the Leyline. Let&#39;s clean them up.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll set up the summoning circle now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yes, nice work as always. I&#39;m glad you managed to establish the base safely.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Now then. I suppose today&#39;s story should be about the United States of America?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Although...I don&#39;t have much relation to that nation at all...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Besides, what kind of fool would put a code in their own self-portrait?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Do you know how it feels to have something like that pushed onto you? Do you?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, setting that aside...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The phrase “e pluribus unum” is their national motto, meaning “out of many, one. ”</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But that is the contradiction.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> To unite many into a single entity,the many must lose their individuality.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They claim to be rationalism incarnate,yet act as champions of justice.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> They strive to be the strongest in the world, yet believe in a god.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The nation of America is the embodiment of contradictory tendencies in humans.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> –And for that reason, their nation has no connection whatsoever to monsters or Magecraft.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> While they may all reach for the same unattainable stars, their approaches are fundamentally different.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But having no connection doesn&#39;t mean one has no knowledge.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A Holy Grail War may have occurred, even in this nation. But that would be in a different world, a faraway world–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s about it for today&#39;s lesson, I think. The summoning circle is established, after all.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, ciao everyone♪Do your best as always!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Hm, night falls quickly. We should rest soon.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;d be one thing if we were all Servants, but we have a Master with us. Plus one of us is wounded.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine! Oww...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I fully understand your condition. Please stop trying to act tough.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> H-Hey! Stop trying to gouge my wounds! Fine, I got it. I want to rest, I really do!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hm, that&#39;s fine I suppose. Hey, Greenie, lend me that towel.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I told you, this isn&#39;t a towel! It&#39;s my Noble Phantasm! It&#39;s not something to sit your ass on!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Haah. You&#39;re so stingy. I can tell how you were raised, you know?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need to be told by some exploitative aristocrat!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> There are silent ways to laugh!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You&#39;re always laughing out loud, though. Geez...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Night gets cold, so I&#39;ll gather firewood now. Sound okay?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes, we aren&#39;t within their sphere of influence yet. It would be a problem if Fujimaru freezes to death.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Okay. Robin, help me out.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go sing for a bit. One needs to keep practicing, no matter the time.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s both the fate and duty of an idol. Also, a life of an idol. Oh, and hope of an idol.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmm, well said. I won&#39;t lose either!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The necrosis in your heart is starting to spread faster. I can still keep you alive for a few days, but–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> After that, I can&#39;t make any promises.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I understand. Just let me rest for now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll inject a double dose of painkillers. That should help.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No, I won&#39;t stay conscious without the pain. I need to be able to move, if the time comes...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll give you the normal dose. Just be prepared for intense pain.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I know. This is a punishment that I must accept.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Punishment?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I suffered an unsightly defeat to Cú Chulainn. Not only that, but to save me–</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Many people were sacrificed. Therefore, this is my punishment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Are idiots allowed to become kings in India?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In what world would people, after risking their lives to save someone, be happy to see that person suffer?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The people who saved you surely wished for your safety, and for your good health.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> All too foolish. Recover from your wounds, and fight to honor those who saved you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is the best, and only, thing you can do for them.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Thanks for the advice.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s a nurse&#39;s duty.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Ah, Master. The stars are beautiful, aren&#39;t they?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing there.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, a primal landscape. A place where it&#39;s hard for people to survive, where only beasts are allowed to live.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> How long do you need to devote to something for a nation to be born here–I can&#39;t even begin to imagine.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Countless people, resources, blood and sweat. The culmination of humanity&#39;s efforts that transcends good and evil.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...No matter how much I thought about it in Chaldea, I couldn&#39;t understand...But I&#39;m starting to see now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s all because of you. Thank you very much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re welcome.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m nothing special.</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Fou?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Don&#39;t run, Fou! Just sit still, and let me brush you!</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou, fou fou!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re being threatened, Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hmph, too bad. By the way, Geronimo was calling for you.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> He wanted to talk about our plans going forward...Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Night is their time. Call for everyone. Let&#39;s fight back!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We&#39;re currently in the western region of North America. The Celtic warriors seem to mainly be coming from the East.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> American army bases and cities have fallen one after another.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> While most of them massacre men and women of all ages, some Servants seem to allow non-combatants to escape.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine to be an honorable Servant, but those that escaped are going to die sooner or later regardless.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The East is almost completely occupied. And...This is the most important part...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They&#39;re using Washington as their base. In other words, the original capital.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you sure of that?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It&#39;s information from a man who escaped from Washington, but I have no proof.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Still, if you don&#39;t mind hearing my personal intuition, I believe this is the enemy&#39;s main stronghold.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Why is that?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> When seeking to humiliate a nation,the most effective method is to occupy their capital.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> On the other hand, the United Western States led by Edison has been actively accepting refugees from the East.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> He makes them work in mechanized infantry factories, and diligently makes improvements each day.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> He is accompanied by Helena Blavatsky, with whom he was also friends in life–</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> As well as one of the most powerful beings in Indian mythology, the “Hero of Benefaction” Karna, from the Mahabharata.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Blavatsky may be obvious, but it&#39;s unknown why Karna would have taken his side...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Regardless, those three and their mechanized infantry seem to be compensating for their lack of Servants.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Now, assuming that Washington is the enemy stronghold–the question is, what should we do next?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I know! Can&#39;t we wait for them to destroy each other?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That would be difficult.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Since the Celts possess the Grail, Edison&#39;s army can&#39;t close the military power gap regardless of the improvements he&#39;s made.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If anything, it&#39;s the chaotic nature of the current situation that allows small forces like us to move around freely.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. Never mind!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Most of us rallying here on this occasion are heroes, but not really heroes.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> An outlaw, an outcast, a lone wolf.... That&#39;s the type of folk we are.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Given the chance, they will exploit that weakness of ours. So there&#39;s only one way to win.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We must search for specific Servants, and eliminate them.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> As I thought, our only option is assassination. We&#39;ll infiltrate their base and take out the Servants.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Um...Is that really okay? There&#39;s more than one of them, right?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You&#39;re correct, dragon girl.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The capital has the toughest defense in a nation. It would be difficult for even an Assassin to infiltrate and assassinate someone.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Normally, at least.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Which means?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Celtic warriors are extremely belligerent.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Also, considering the haphazard nature of their invasions, it&#39;s obvious they simply do as they please.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> In other words–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The Celtic warriors won&#39;t place any emphasis on defending the capital?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That&#39;s my speculation. They simply see a fortress as a place to live, and not a place to defend.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They stress about how strong their warriors ought to be— Their society values individuals more than the whole.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ah, I get it. Rather than build up a castle&#39;s defenses, they think they can rely on their own strength.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s the opposite of Edison, who believes in uniformity and strength in numbers. No wonder their castle is shorthanded.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yeah. However, this is a gamble.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We have no way to defend the West. We must gamble since the difference in military strength is overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hmm, I guess this really is the bottom of the barrel.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like it, but I doubt there&#39;s a better plan than this.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I got no problem with this plan.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> No matter how slim it may be, I will take any chance I can get. An all-or-nothing gamble scares me.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Lancer and I don&#39;t mind, either.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right. We&#39;re really busy, so the sooner it ends the better.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Medical treatment is pointless if it doesn&#39;t address the source. If Washington is the lesion, it must be cut out.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...However, we should prioritize treatment of this patient first.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;m fine...Or so I&#39;d like to say, but I&#39;m useless when it comes to assassination. I&#39;ll only slow you down.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes, exactly. That&#39;s why I want to split our force into two.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> One group will go with Nightingale in pursuit of the Servant Sita, who has ties to Rama, for his treatment.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The other will infiltrate the East,and carry out the assassination.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...The assassination mission is dangerous, there&#39;s a high chance of failure. We must avoid clumping up and getting wiped out.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Personally, I&#39;d like Mash and Fujimaru to accompany Nightingale and Rama.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What do you think?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Us?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Yes. To put it one way...You&#39;re our ace in the hole. Literally, our trump card.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> If all goes well and we eliminate the enemy, that&#39;s fine. If we can&#39;t, the rest is in your hands.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai? I&#39;ll leave the decision up to the Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Very well, I&#39;ll leave it to you. Now, in terms of balance...I&#39;d like at least one more Servant to go along with you.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Hm, okay. Lancer...No, Elisabeth. You should go with them.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh? Why me? We&#39;re not going together?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu. While I&#39;d love to see whose song is better...We can&#39;t exactly sing loudly during an assassination mission.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That would be boring.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That&#39;s why when we meet again, we&#39;ll make a big stage. They&#39;ll be the judges, and we&#39;ll finally settle things.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> To see who the true idol is!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh...How splendid! A once-in-a-lifetime performance! I&#39;d expect no less from my rival. You think BIG!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Judges?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s just pretend we didn&#39;t hear that.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But in that case, shouldn&#39;t you go with the Master instead of me, Nero? Can you handle something as complicated as an assassination?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hehehe, sorry to disappoint you, but I&#39;m more fitted for assassination.... Why, you ask?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I&#39;m Nero Claudius. I&#39;m a veteran of both assassinating and being assassinated!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Life as emperor is filled with conspiracies. Kill or be killed, poison or be poisoned. It&#39;s filled with gory details.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Umu. I feel sad just saying that...Either way, there&#39;s no one more suited for assassination than me!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ahem...Go on, feel free to applaud. Applaud.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s not something to brag about, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I know. Even I&#39;m not even really trying to brag.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> But with my “Imperial Privilege,” I can mimic an Assassin for a while.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> There&#39;s also another very important reason.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Important...reason?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What could that be...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu. Well you see...Rama and I are way too similar!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> That&#39;s all!?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What do you mean, that&#39;s all? It&#39;s important not to have overlapping characteristics!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...In that case, we can&#39;t help it. That&#39;s a fatal issue for any group, after all...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It&#39;s really that important? So much so that you accepted it instantly!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru. I&#39;m really confused here!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You say that, but...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Okay, settle down a bit, patient.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Owwww!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Individuality is important.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Fujimaru, you too? So characteristic overlap...is really that important...</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s fine. You&#39;d better get that assassination done, Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That goes without saying. Just leave it to me. It&#39;s like a secret live performance.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That settles it, then. Myself, Robin, Billy, and Nero...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Our team will head to the East for the assassinations. And–</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Nightingale, Rama, Mash, Elisabeth,and Master Fujimaru...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Your team will head to Alcatraz Island to rescue Sita. Any issues with that, Master?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Not at all.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please be careful.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Of course. Very well, we&#39;ll depart tomorrow morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll give you a communication device. We can use it to decide where to rendezvous afterwards.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Sure. Now rest up and prepare for tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Particularly you, Master. You need to head back west. Make sure you eat something and sleep well tonight.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We&#39;ll be heading to the East now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, and we&#39;ll head to Alcatraz Island.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure there are Celtic Servants posted at Alcatraz Island as well. Be careful.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. You too, Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Master. Our time together was short, but enjoyable. I pray for success on your end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You sound like you&#39;re going to die.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You sound like we won&#39;t meet again.</p><hr><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Hm, I suppose I do sound like that.... Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hey, Master. Don&#39;t worry, this will be quick.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Just sit tight and wait for the good news! ...Just kidding.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Take care of the little princess here, Master.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, it should be the other way around! I&#39;m going to take care of these guys.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah.... Anyway, time to get to work.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu. Fujimaru, watch over Lancer for me.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, you too, Saber? That&#39;s so rude.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ahahahaha. Forgive me, Lancer.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Listen, Saber. This is a promise. When you come back, we&#39;ll settle who number one is–</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I know. We&#39;ll have a showdown, fair and square,and see who&#39;s more worthy of the audience&#39;s applause!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I&#39;ll show you my true strength when that time comes! —It&#39;s mind-blowing, by the way!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> So she&#39;s been holding back all this time? Now that&#39;s a scary thought.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, go and kill them all, Saber. We still have that collaboration between Golden Theater and Castle Csejte to do.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu, leave everything to me!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Well, let&#39;s get moving.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu. It was a quick farewell, but I have no regrets. Now, to finish our tasks.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re not going to our deaths, Nero.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I&#39;m aware of that. But I also know how dangerous assassination plots can be.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> We&#39;re infiltrating deep into enemy lines. Prioritizing our own survival reduces the chance of success.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, are you planning to...</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Say nothing more. It would be insensitive of you, Archer...I mean, Robin Hood.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I intend to survive. My stubbornness is second to none, after all!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s true. I don&#39;t intend to die, either. Let&#39;s just do our best.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hey, Geronimo.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I&#39;m an American, so it&#39;s fine, but...You&#39;re a proud Apache, right?</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Is it really okay? Saving this nation, I mean.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> You&#39;re still saying that? If this nation isn&#39;t saved, we won&#39;t be saved, either.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Besides, the idea of America owing me a debt is pleasant.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Even if all is lost and forgotten once the world corrects itself.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for you to feel any sort of guilt.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...I see. Then I&#39;ll go with that.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> I just hope this assassination goes well.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Master. It seems he&#39;s finally approaching his limit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please try to make haste. If not, I may be forced to amputate the patient&#39;s limbs...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Anything but that. Haha, I need to show some willpower...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This patient&#39;s display of toughness is praise-worthy. An ordinary person would have broken mentally already.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I can&#39;t die until I meet my wife. That is my duty, as the king of Kosala.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...At least, that&#39;s what I tried to do. But she ended up being harmed for that reason.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right, according to the Ramayana, you suspected your wife of infidelity, and tested her twice.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Seriously? No wonder she got mad at you.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...No, I never suspected my wife of infidelity. But that wasn&#39;t enough to appease the people.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> The first ceremony should have removed all doubt...But the people continued to suspect her.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...You trusted her, right?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I did. However, I still exiled her. I had no choice.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What the...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that the same as suspecting her?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! You&#39;re the worst! Simply the worst!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-Um, both of you, calm down...He&#39;s injured.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...No, they&#39;re right. I truly am the worst.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Self-protection, embarrassment, fear...As one ages, various things intertwine, and tie you down.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This truth is evident from my being summoned as a youth. Back during this time, all I felt for Sita was love.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You could say that was my peak condition...Back when that was enough for me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Then you must endure, until you meet your love once again. If you truly love her, you must prove it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If not, it would be the same as if you didn&#39;t love her. Some things must be said to truly be understood.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I understand that. Now, let&#39;s hurry. I&#39;m still fine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We should hurry, Master.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right. At the very least, this lady Sita needs to give this man a good slap across the face.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If it comes down to it, I could even lend her my microphone!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Haha, that sounds painful.... Hm? Master, there seems to be enemies about.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I&#39;ve detected enemies. They&#39;re Celt warriors, but their numbers are few.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood. Let&#39;s go, Master!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s hurry onwards. No stops until Alcatraz.</p><h2 id="section-11-the-rock" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-11-the-rock" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 11: The Rock</h2><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve arrived. That island over there is Alcatraz Island.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It&#39;s unexpectedly close. But we still can&#39;t exactly swim there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The chance of being noticed by enemy Servants—</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> The island&#39;s not that big...Anybody could notice us when we land. No use worrying about that.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> More importantly, I don&#39;t want to swim. Got that?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Can&#39;t swim?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Sink like a rock?</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s not it! I&#39;ve...never properly swam before, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;d be fine!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What I&#39;m trying to say is,I don&#39;t want to swim in the ocean.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Seawater dries out my skin.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It might be fine for the Servants, but I&#39;m sure it would be hard for our Master Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Currents are swift, and the water is cold. It&#39;s an extremely unfit place to swim.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ll try searching for a boat that&#39;ll get us across.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Maybe we should ask the old man over there.... Um, excuse me?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re looking for a boat to cross over to that island–</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> ...Forget it. There are demons living on that island now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Demons?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I know because I&#39;m originally from England. Those were “dragonkin. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Old Man:</strong><br> If you really want to go, I can lend you my boat...But you&#39;d better pay for it if you break it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...There you have it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Dragonkin, huh? That&#39;s not too bad, I&#39;m a Dragonkin too. Well, a Demi at that.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Wait...You are!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Where did you think my tail and horns came from?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> That&#39;s...I thought you were just into things like that...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> When you&#39;ve healed, Sita won&#39;t be the only one slapping you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-That&#39;s enough.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Dragons waiting at our destination or not, this patient is at his limit.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We shouldn&#39;t be afraid of a fight. We need to go, there&#39;s no time to waste.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right, it&#39;ll be fine. We fought more than enough dragonkin in France, after all.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There were wyverns everywhere we looked...As a fellow Demi-Dragon, it got old really fast.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I see. The journey to save the world sounds like quite the ordeal.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Anyway, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Set sail!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> ...Hm. One, two, three, four...But one of them seems weakened...Is that one injured?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> So that really means three. Seriously? ONLY three?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I just hope there&#39;s enough for everyone to get their fill...</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Tch...Whatever. All right. Guys, you&#39;ve got work.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> You&#39;re not just here to live idly and eat humans. Go put yourselves to the test!</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>G：???:</strong><br> —Lord Rama?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already picked up several enemy wyvern responses. Also–</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A Servant is here.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Right. But the Servant doesn&#39;t seem to be moving.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The wyverns seem to be deployed to form a path to the enemy Servant.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Which means?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...We&#39;re likely being tested. He&#39;s saying, “I&#39;m right here. Come at me...”</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And if we don&#39;t defeat that Servant, we likely won&#39;t be able to meet Sita.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Let&#39;s head straight there. Considering the patient&#39;s condition, we don&#39;t have a moment to lose.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No need to wait for permission to operate. Cutting straight through!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, w-wait! ...Then again, I guess Nightingale isn&#39;t exactly the type of person to wait...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s follow her. There&#39;s no mistake that her choice is the fastest option. No sense in overthinking.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. It&#39;s good when things are easy to understand. Let&#39;s charge, full speed ahead!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here they come. Wyverns and Celtic warriors! Master, please give me your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whew, piece of cake! Are you still doing okay?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Yes, somewhat. Right now, I&#39;m just worried whether I&#39;ll be able to meet Sita again or not.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh? We&#39;re busy fighting for our lives,and you&#39;re thinking about your wife?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I-I can&#39;t fight like this, I can&#39;t help it! I&#39;d love to fight if I could!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No, I meant the opposite. That&#39;s a good thing. I thought you were some playboy prince, but you&#39;re actually really nice.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Okay, I feel more motivated! Leave these weaklings to me. I&#39;ll make sure you see your wife again!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But in exchange, you&#39;d better apologize to her properly. Every girl wants to know that someone needs them.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Y-Yes...That&#39;s right. I just hope I have the chance to apologize...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We must push forward and defeat them, for his treatment!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Ugh...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you okay!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Don&#39;t hurt yourself too much for me, Nightingale. I know of shame, and you mentioned something similar earlier.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I don&#39;t wish for you to be harmed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Be quiet. For me, the second most hated thing in this world is an incurable illness.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What I hate most are patients who don&#39;t try to recover.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> S-Shouldn&#39;t it be the opposite?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No. Incurable diseases will become curable someday.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Doctors and nurses like myself constantly work towards that goal, racking our minds and building knowledge.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We must cure illness, even if that means killing people. Disease must be killed, massacred, and exterminated.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –But to do that, a patient&#39;s willpower is imperative.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Curing a patient who has no will to recover is impossible, for any doctor.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Medical treatment can only begin when someone has the will to be healed.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I intend to cure you. I&#39;ll cure you so you can act openheartedly.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll cure you so that you may whisper words of love to your wife. I&#39;ll cure you—so you can wield your sword and fight.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But for that, your body, your cells,must have the determination to recover.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If you lose willpower, muster it up again. Otherwise, I&#39;ll kill you myself.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...You know, you really are a Berserker!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You disapprove?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Not at all...I got it. I&#39;ll recover. I WILL recover. I have the desire to do so.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I refuse to die, not until my wish is fulfilled!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This is the final gate. Please hold out just a little longer.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A Servant!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hey. Welcome to the Alcatraz Penitentiary. Are you here for imprisonment? An attack? Aiding a jailbreak?</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Let me know what you want. I&#39;ll think about it after I kill you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> This patient&#39;s wife seems to be held here. She&#39;s necessary for his recovery, please release her.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> What, you&#39;re here for a meeting? Seriously, you didn&#39;t come to fight?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Of course not. Why would a nurse want to fight? The only things that nurses fight are illness and injury.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> You&#39;re absolutely correct. A nurse who takes lives would be out of their mind.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Hmm? That means you&#39;re actually not crazy? You&#39;re quite the respectable Servant!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I must agree with our enemy.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This nurse here is a contradictory woman,someone who&#39;s crazy yet isn&#39;t crazy either.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Oh? I thought you were just their luggage, but you can talk? I get it. You&#39;re that lady&#39;s husband.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you,I have no intention of letting her go.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –So you are obstructing treatment of an injured man. Obstacles must be eliminated.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I wish for bloodshed. No, I thirst for it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If it means saving a patient,I&#39;ll remove all obstacles down to their roots!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> Heh...Hahahaha! How amusing! So Berserkers come in different varieties too!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh...This Servant doesn&#39;t make me feel well...I feel it in my horns!</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure, young lady! After all, my True Name is Beowulf–the “Dragon Slayer. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The famed hero of the oldest English epic poem, Beowulf!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> He&#39;s a formidable enemy, so don&#39;t hold back. Everyone, fight him together!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh, we&#39;re starting with a group fight? I see you guys are going all out, I like that!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wha...A dragonkin? It wasn&#39;t just wyverns?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I handpicked this one. A bit of a waste to use in skirmishes, but good enough as a test.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It&#39;s obvious that we&#39;re enemies,but there are still codes of conduct to follow.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I admire those who are strong, even enemies. Fear not death, but extravagance, and never forget honor.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> That&#39;s the rule of our world. Well, it just means you need to fight, and prove yourself.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> This world is filled with conflict, and this nation is being swallowed into the mud of war.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> If you have a problem with that, come and fight. Prove that your life is worth living. Prove that you&#39;re warriors.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> If you manage that, let&#39;s see...I&#39;ll at least remember your names!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on? You don&#39;t feel pain, woman? Or, do you have a heart of iron?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Edison&#39;s mechanized soldier is more human than you. You&#39;re like steel in human clothes, Berserker!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m often told that. I don&#39;t care at all. My body is simply a means to heal patients, after all.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You&#39;re like a puppet just doing what it was built for! Looks like I need to crush you completely to stop you!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Wait. Nightingale, I have a request.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –You&#39;re a patient, please be quiet.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No, this is necessary for my treatment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...What is it?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Put me down.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I can&#39;t do that.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Put me down, for the sake of treatment. If you fall, who will treat me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> —Can you even fight?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Believe in me. A patient and doctor must first trust each other, right?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Just one correction. I&#39;m a nurse, not a doctor.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hey, I want to fight that living iron puppet lady over there.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I have no interest in fighting a living corpse. Just go die in a corner or something.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. I&#39;m just a living corpse. However...Listen to me.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I have quite the story for you. A sweet deal. You won&#39;t lose out.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hm? You&#39;ve come to a prison, and you got a sweet deal? You trying to bribe the jailer or something—</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> —“Brahmastra! ”</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got a pretty face, but you pull a surprise attack like that? Damn, now that&#39;s interesting!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Shut up! Stand aside! For getting in the way of love, you could&#39;ve got it much worse!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> My wife is waiting for me! I&#39;m not going to be picky about my methods!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Heh...Haha, of course! That&#39;s definitely my bad!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I tried acting like a big villain, but that was more like some petty underling!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> All right, bring it on, frail boy! If you manage to beat me now, that&#39;s a victory for justice!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Put your life on the line for your woman, and die with honor!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> —Tch, I can&#39;t even win against a man who&#39;s half-dead...I&#39;ve lost, no matter how anyone looks at it.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Fine, I surrender. Do whatever you want. I&#39;m not so tasteless as to stand in the way of your love.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Damn, bringing love affairs onto the battlefield...I&#39;m weak against things like that.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> To be honest, I wanted to wipe you guys out, or be completely wiped out myself...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh, by the way, I didn&#39;t lay a finger on the prisoner. She&#39;s so dainty, I felt like she&#39;d snap just by touching her.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That means...you&#39;re surrendering from battle?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. We can talk somewhere else. Just get going, frail boy. Your dainty wife is waiting.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yes...I&#39;ll do that!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> ......Lord Rama?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Is that you, Sita? I&#39;ve come for you...I&#39;ve...come...</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Lord Rama!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rama, you shouldn&#39;t run in your condition...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Ah, damn it. My vision&#39;s all blurry. I can&#39;t see a thing.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I&#39;m right here, Lord Rama.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Where...Sita...Where are you?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...I wanted to see you. I wanted to see you. I really, really wanted to see you again.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You being there for me was all I needed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rama!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –We must begin treatment at once.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, normally we wouldn&#39;t conduct medical procedures in such an unsanitary place.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But you&#39;re a Servant, so this is an exception. Feel free to hold his hand, no need for hesitation.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...What happened to Lord Rama?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll explain. You see–</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> My, something like that happened? To think I could ever be of use to Lord Rama...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Um, so who exactly are you?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I am “Rama. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What...What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Are you familiar with the curse placed on Lord Rama?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> If I recall...When he killed the monkey Vali with an ambush from behind, the monkey&#39;s wife cast a curse on him.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Yes. That curse keeps us apart, even as Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> We can never meet again.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> When participating in a Holy Grail War as Servants,either he or I get summoned as Rama.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> We are never summoned simultaneously. Even in Holy Grail Wars, we are fated to never meet again.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...Even this unique situation is no different. When he awakens, I will most likely vanish.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That can&#39;t be...</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> –But it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m fine with that. While Lord Rama wasn&#39;t able to see me...</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I was able to be here, and hold his hand. That&#39;s...enough for me to be happy.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> –Are you really okay with that? What about a heartfelt apology? An oath of love, from the bottom of his soul?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> You don&#39;t want something like that? This man betrayed you once before, right?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> This man fought for 14 years, for my sake.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> He faced Ravana, even though we had only lived together for a year.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> He could have forgotten about me, and taken a new wife–but he never did, to the day he died.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough. I know his love and passion well enough. That&#39;s why we will...continue yearning for each other.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Even if it&#39;s an impossible wish, we&#39;ll continue to believe that it&#39;ll come true one day.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I see. It sounds like you had a short, but happy time together.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The mending is mostly complete,but “something” is nestled inside, interfering.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s likely the curse of Gáe Bolg.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Even if he recovers from his wound, I doubt he will be able to fight...I am sorry to say.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> In that case, I shall offer this body.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I&#39;ll dispel the curse with my body. I&#39;ll burden myself with the curse, then disappear.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Luckily, Rama and I are “one and the same. ” It should be simple to take the curse in his place.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-Please wait! That defeats the purpose of us coming here!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rama was able to come this far...because it was all for you!</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;m saying, those feelings...are enough to fulfill me.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Also, from what you just told me, you need a strong warrior more than anything now. Isn&#39;t that right?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> In that case, my husband...Lord Rama, is the most powerful warrior in this world.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Very well, I&#39;ll transplant the lesion to you. Are you sure this is okay?</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Yes, please do so.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –I never married in my lifetime. However, I still understand your feelings of wanting to help another.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Though only a short while, it was an honor to speak with you. Farewell, Mrs. Sita.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> Lord Rama...Rama. I can take just a small portion of your burden.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> ...I can aid your fight, even if it&#39;s only for a little. But that&#39;s more than enough to make me happy.</p><p><strong>Sita:</strong><br> I love you...I really, really do love you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Mr. Rama. Mr. Rama! Can you hear my voice? Should I fire a gun next to your ear?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t do that...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ......Ah, she is gone.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Yes, to cure you.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I see...I thought she might do that, considering how abnormal this Holy Grail War is.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> So this is also destiny, I suppose.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> She held your hand, and kissed you. She offered you her tears, and her love.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you&#39;re standing here, alive.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> –Thank you, Nightingale. Those words alone give me salvation.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need for a thank you. This is what gives my life meaning, after all.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Nightingale, Mash, Elisabeth, Dr. Roman...and Master.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.

Completely.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wonderful. Truly the most exciting treatment.</p><h2 id="section-12-sympathy-for-the-soldier" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-12-sympathy-for-the-soldier" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 12: Sympathy for the Soldier</h2><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...How&#39;d it go?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m done scouting. Geez. I&#39;m really overusing “No Face May King. ”</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> We can&#39;t help it. If I went scouting, it would cause a huge uproar.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I guess that&#39;s true! But anyway...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It seems like they intend to hold a large-scale parade along this major street.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> A parade? Why would they do that?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That I don&#39;t know.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Still, that&#39;s definitely what those Celts are preparing.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> A parade...How outrageous! No, enviable!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that the opposite!?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Archer. What a sad man...Have you never held a parade?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Why would I? I&#39;m just a regular guy.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Parades are great...All the people shouting my name, the orderly troops marching along in perfect step.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> One wave of the hand, and I&#39;m showered with “Wonderful! ” “Superb! ” “Hurray! ” “Lady Nero, sleep with me! ”</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu, now I want to hold a parade, too.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...I see. That sounds like an exciting time for anyone. Let&#39;s take out the target at the parade.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Target who, exactly?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> The Servant with the highest honors held at the parade...Although it might not be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Billy. At a parade, the person of highest influence must also stand out the most.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> That&#39;s the whole point of the event. But that also makes it a good opportunity for assassination.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Hmm, it&#39;s not easy being a show-off.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Robin, did you notice any Servants lurking about?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I sensed two. If there were any others, they weren&#39;t within my detection range.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> The two there are surrounded by Celtic warriors.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> So most of the Servants are absent...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> But we don&#39;t know for sure. They could have just been outside of Robin&#39;s range.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> There&#39;s always the possibility of an ambush.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m an Archer. My Servant detection range is pretty far, you know?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Then again, Servants can indeed close in from outside detection range in an instant...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> –What should we do, Geronimo?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...We have to do it. This is undoubtedly a golden opportunity.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We didn&#39;t have to fight on the way here at all. Meanwhile, Mash and company made a bold move out in the West.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the enemy is already aware of our actions.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They might feel that something is up, but they surely don&#39;t think we have this many Servants lined up.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Yes. So what should we do?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Nero, what kind of Noble Phantasm do you have?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hm? My Noble Phantasm? My Noble Phantasm is—</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> I see. Then we&#39;ll use that. There&#39;s no need to hold back on using Noble Phantasms. We&#39;ll end things here.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu! This is a great stage for our big moment!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Understood. Let&#39;s end this quickly, and make our escape.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Yeah, let&#39;s do our best!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> –Then let&#39;s follow the plan.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;ll use “No Face May King” to disappear and get close...Make way for the Faceless King!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That woman&#39;s standing above the Celtic warriors– I see, she&#39;s the queen!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Everyone! Thank you so much for coming here to see me, Medb!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This nation belongs to the Eternal King!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A nation of Cú and myself, made by Cú and myself, for Cú and myself!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Be honored that you serve us 24 hours a day. Rejoice that you are our subordinates 24 hours a day.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Justice, honor, and glory all belong to us!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> –Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Got it. Removing “No Face May King”! Go, Saber!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Yes, leave it to me!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Queen Medb! You may look cute, but your reign comes to an end now!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Sunlight of spring, dancing flowers! The winds of May that brush your cheeks! The blessed bells that ring all the way beyond stella!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Open, Nuptiae Domus Aurea!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Could this be...a Reality Marble!? No, this is different. This is Magecraft! Unwavering, unhesitant Magecraft!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s so beautiful! I want this Noble Phantasm!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> This Noble Phantasm is beyond you, but we have a great banquet for you tonight! Brace yourself!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Queen of Connacht, Medb! Sorry, but we&#39;ll be taking your head!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> –Here goes!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh my, so many! And because of this barrier, my warriors are weakened, too!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> This is bad! I&#39;m in big trouble! Big, big trouble!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Save me, my king!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Bring on your so-called king!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is the moment of truth. Put some spirit into this!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Wait. I&#39;ve got a bad feeling!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Haaaaah!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ugh...He has this much strength inside my Golden Theater!?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> A bold plan, but a failure. You should have targeted me, not Medb.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Child of Light, Cú Chulainn! Still in that ominous form, I see.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It seems you&#39;re the holder of the Holy Grail!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t care about the Grail. I gave that thing to Medb.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Then what&#39;s this strength!? You&#39;re within Nero&#39;s Bounded Field!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I wished for it!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I wished for Cú to “become a king”! A strong and wicked king, who could stand equal to me!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> –I see. If it&#39;s a wish upon the Grail, it&#39;s no wonder he can surpass this Bounded Field...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That doesn&#39;t matter. All I sought was this situation. I decided to reign supreme as “king,” and fight with all my might.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Oh? So you&#39;re a “king”? Let me ask you as an emperor. How do you intend to take the right of leadership?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll fight, kill, and conquer. That&#39;s all.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Is that really all?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not the type to rule through wisdom. Besides, everyone living on this land is a warrior.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take everything, kill everyone, and dominate everywhere...Then, when there&#39;s nothing left– I will return to the void.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What...In that case, you&#39;re no different from a mindless beast!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> And what&#39;s wrong with that? We were born into an era that&#39;s neither dream nor reality.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If everything&#39;s an illusion to begin with, we should all vanish without building anything, no?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So you would deny prosperity...You are not fit to be a king!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh, but he is.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The qualification to be king is absolute strength. Enough to declare domination and create a nation alone.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That alone is enough for people to follow. Everything else can be handled by others.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I mean, mankind is enslaved by strength. The weak will cling to the strong as long as they get to pick up the leftover glory.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s just the way of the world. Aren&#39;t you the same?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Hah. I like lions, but mad dogs aren&#39;t my cup of tea. When it comes down to it, you&#39;re just another dog, a bitch, who seduced a lion.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. I don&#39;t mind being a bitch. I don&#39;t mind at all.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I mean, I fell in love. What am I supposed to do? That&#39;s right...Ever since the day I failed to take Ulster!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A warrior who wouldn&#39;t become mine,a man who didn&#39;t heed to my will.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> A great hero who protected his nation alone,who boasted to none, and ended his life with a smile!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> As far as I know, Cú Chulainn is stronger than anyone or anything, and I&#39;ve always loved him!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I see. Then watch as the man you love falls!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Here I go!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> We&#39;re right behind you!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Got it! ...Wait, are you kidding me?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> A Servant...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –To be perfectly honest, I thought Cú would be more than enough here.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But I figured I&#39;d have one more as backup, just in case. I&#39;m so smart!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh dear. Don&#39;t look at me like that, Cú. This doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t trust you, okay?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But sometimes there&#39;s strength in numbers, you know? Like right now.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll handle that woman. Take care of the other weaklings.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Excited?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> No. This is a matter of principle. If she calls herself an emperor, then it&#39;s my duty as a king to crush her.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Okay♪ Then go right ahead and handle the others, Arjuna!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Did she say...Arjuna!?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Arjuna, the eternal archenemy of Karna?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> This is the worst...To think that they have something like that hidden up their sleeve! I underestimated them!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I have no intention of making you suffer. Please let me finish my duty quickly.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> What should we do, Geronimo?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> –Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What!?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Take the communicator.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Use “No Face May King” and get out of here. We&#39;ll buy you some time.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What are you doing, Archer!? Go!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Unfortunately, I can&#39;t leave this place. I cannot afford to leave!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> I need to teach this man a thing or two about how to conduct oneself as a king!</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> –Listen well. You must live, and meet up with Fujimaru. We haven&#39;t been defeated yet.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Just go! Then return to this land with the song of victory!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s a tough order, but I got it. I&#39;ll be getting out of here first, Your Majesty.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Yes, that&#39;s more like it, Hunter of the Forest. I&#39;m counting on you.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Now then— Sorry to keep you waiting, Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> So, thorny man. I think you&#39;re overdoing it a bit with that imposing look.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re right, but give me a break. This is me holding it back as much as I can.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Got that, girl? If you intend to win,you&#39;ve got to settle things before it bursts open.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Now, why don&#39;t you show me how a king is supposed to act?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I have no intention of learning, though. Stuff like that isn&#39;t tasty.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Umu. It&#39;s not tasty, but it&#39;s meaningful. King of Beasts, I&#39;ll beat some humanity into you!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There seem to be some survivors left. We should eliminate them as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right. Once we&#39;re done with this assassination,I need to have that singing match with Saber, after all.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I-I see...I hope that works out for you...</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s leave this island.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wait! Enemy signals detected–Servants closing in!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> These are...the first enemy Servants you met!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The first enemy Servants...Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hey there, Lady Mash. Do you remember my promise from before?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Oh, that...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m serious this time. That is, if you manage to survive your defeat!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> You&#39;ll be mine. In other words, I want you as my bride.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> A proposal? That was a marriage proposal just now! Mash, you&#39;re unexpectedly popular!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. I already declined...Or rather, considering the situation, it&#39;s out of the question...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Now, don&#39;t say that. We&#39;ve been moved by your tremendous courage, Lady Mash.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hm, Diarmuid can&#39;t stand women, and even he&#39;s interested! Hehehe, are you sweeping her off her feet right before my eyes again?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I-I wouldn&#39;t do something like that...I&#39;m not even thinking about it!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I just, I simply admire Lady Mash for her unwavering courage, that&#39;s all...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahaha, I&#39;m joking. I took it too far. Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I should be the one begging for forgiveness, after all. Yes, I really can&#39;t do anything about this personality of mine.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> However, that&#39;s enough. I&#39;ll stop joking around. I&#39;ll let go of all the grudges I had in life. That&#39;s because—</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Young warrior, we are here to fight side by side. There is no greater joy than that on this earth.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> !!! Of course. That&#39;s most certain, my king!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> –We can make up for their numbers with our own. Beowulf, what say you?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Huh? I don&#39;t feel like it. I&#39;m going back east.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Besides, I didn&#39;t take on this job because I wanted to.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I see. Do as you please. Very well...We&#39;ll fight this one by ourselves.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Here they come! A large army of Celtic warriors!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Well, didn&#39;t you resurrect a mighty Servant who could stand up to this army?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right! Master, there&#39;s no need to worry.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> My Noble Phantasm is a divine blade, bestowed by Brahma. Sheer numbers are no match for me!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Not to mention, I am now one with Sita!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> If you seek to defeat me, bring a million soldiers and their leader with ten heads and twenty arms to face me!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This is nothing!! Hahaha! I feel great today, I could face another 10,000 opponents!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wow, you&#39;re doing really well there, prince. I won&#39;t lose either!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Get to work, ghosts of Csejte. Now, I&#39;ll charm you with this hit song of mine!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Wait, wait, wait! You&#39;re a Servant, but you&#39;re also a nurse, right?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;m a nurse. That&#39;s why I intend to kill you.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That&#39;s some strange reasoning! Tch...That didn&#39;t work!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> How is it strange? You&#39;re like patients, delirious with a fever.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If I don&#39;t cure it, you won&#39;t be saved! That&#39;s why I intend to save you, even if I have to kill you!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Mm...Your reasoning is absurd, but your beliefs are real. I take back what I said earlier.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Your attempts to save others are noble. But I still serve my king.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> As long as I am alive, I will die for his life! Bring it!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> As long as you are alive...Is that so? Well then, allow me to relieve you of your royal duties!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We have you now,Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid Ua Duibhne!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Very well. It&#39;s finally time to settle this! Will we get married or not? Let&#39;s begin the fight!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My King, please don&#39;t let your guard down on account of your bride&#39;s beauty. She is already a powerful foe. Please give up this talk of marriage.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Hahahaha! A shame, but of course, Diarmuid! Did you think we could defeat them whilst holding back?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> No, not at all.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Right? Heh heh, as long as we&#39;re Servants...we can&#39;t escape from this desire.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> To battle the strong. To carve away at life and soul.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> That&#39;s why the Holy Grail War continues! ...Thinking of it that way, our king is quite an exception.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> He&#39;s no doubt the most powerful warrior, so I can&#39;t believe he doesn&#39;t feel any joy!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He feels no joy?</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Heh. Go meet him if you want to know more. Although he shows no mercy to his enemies!</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> That&#39;s enough idle chat.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> I am Diarmuid Ua Duibhne–the first spear of the Knights of Fianna! Here I come!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, agreed! I am Fionn mac Cumhaill, captain of the Knights of Fianna! To battle!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My king! ...Guh, I can&#39;t go on...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Haha...Well, it can&#39;t be helped. I fought plenty, I&#39;ve had my fill.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Diarmuid, I&#39;m quite satisfied. But are you still not content?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> ...Yes. I thought victory would be ours this time.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> –Well, to be honest. I didn&#39;t care if we won or lost this time.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> When I was alive, I became more and more tainted.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> The glimmer in my eyes wallowed within politics. The treasure, power, and duty I won tied me down more and more.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> It was painful. So painful, yet I couldn&#39;t let it go.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> –I fear that&#39;s why I envied you so much,as you were trying to die for your love.</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> My king...You...</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> We fought together. In a pure yet avaricious pursuit of victory.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I&#39;m satisfied...Although to be honest, it&#39;s regrettable that I couldn&#39;t take Lady Mash as my own...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m very sorry. I can&#39;t accept your request.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, I&#39;ve been rejected! Now I shall pass on...Without regretfully clinging onto this world.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Would you accompany me, Diarmuid?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> Yes, sir!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> As for you, Berserker. Do you not seek to heal your own wounds?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s not necessary. I have neither the time nor the means to heal myself.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My heart is torn to pieces by the simple existence of patients, after all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s why...If I was to be healed, it would be when there are no more patients in the world.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Until then, I will bear any wound as compensation.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> I see. You are broken, yet beautiful. Your conviction is like a dazzling jewel.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Next time I&#39;m summoned, I&#39;d like to aid your cause. What do you think, making passes at my next bridal candidate?</p><p><strong>Diarmuid:</strong><br> What is there to say? It&#39;s very like you to do so, my king.</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Yes, very well! It was worthwhile being summoned,if only because I was able to live youthfully until death!</p><p><strong>Fionn:</strong><br> Farewell, defenders of order! Let us meet again, if fate allows!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> –Confirmed elimination of Spirit Origins.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Light and cheerful to the very end...Quite the pleasant pair.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But considering how they gathered such a large force here, the assassination by the others must have gone well...Right?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> –We&#39;ve received a transmission. Huh? It&#39;s not Geronimo, but Robin Hood?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll switch to open transmission.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> –Sorry. We screwed up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!! Tell us what happened, Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Old Man Geronimo, Billy, and Saber...Nero. They&#39;re probably all gone.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> —What? Hey, what are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m heading to an abandoned Western United States base. Do you know the coordinates? I might need you to come right away.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What happened?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know. Doctor, do you know the location Robin specified?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-Yeah. Of course. Obtaining communicator coordinates–code received.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ll send you the shortest route to the destination. Head over there right away.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re kidding. That was a lie, right?

By the True Name of ■■■■■, lend me your power.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Unleashing Noble Phantasm– “Tsago Degi Naleya! ”</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> –Howl. “Agni Gandiva! ”</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> My spirits, destroyed with a single blow. As expected from the strongest hero of India!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But I don&#39;t understand. You possess such power, yet why?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I have my reasons.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> –Take this!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> ...You can even repel bullets!?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> The fact that a modern weapon like that can harm me is praiseworthy enough.</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Well, thank you...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Mmph!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> –However, it won&#39;t reach me. I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;ll settle this now.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Ah...Sorry...Geronimo...</p><p><strong>Billy:</strong><br> Dammit, I wish I had been a little more useful...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...This is the end.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Arjuna...You&#39;re decent. You still have a sound mind...</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Why did you join them?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hehehehehe! You can&#39;t answer them, can you Arjuna?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> ...Queen Medb. To think you&#39;d serve Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Of course I would. I mean,Cú decided for himself to become king.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Not out of righteousness, or nobility, or even ambition. He just wanted to heighten himself.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The ones you sent to Alcatraz will be finished off by Beowulf, Fionn, and Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Well, even if they fail to, that&#39;s not a problem. Your defeat is already certain.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So long as we have the Holy Grail,this world will persistently continue to reincarnate.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> All that&#39;s left is to destroy Edison&#39;s army. That&#39;s easy.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> –Ah, I see. So you don&#39;t actually know yet.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t know what?</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> It seems you think you&#39;re some sort of chosen one, who obtained absolute power–</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> But actually, you&#39;re just one out of seven.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> Indeed, the fact you obtained the Grail is proof of your greatness.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> However, while it is rare, it is not the “only one. ”If anyone has the “only one,” it&#39;s us.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> They have already recovered four Holy Grails.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> That is why. Even if we fall here...others will take our place.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I see. But none of you have a chance against our king. A Mad King and a War King, Cú stands at the pinnacle of power.</p><p><strong>Geronimo:</strong><br> As a shaman, let me make a prediction for you. Be glad, you&#39;ll die happy. Unfortunately, it&#39;ll be real soon.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –Hmph.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Arjuna. Go and chase down the Servant who escaped.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, Cú. Do you want me to help?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> No, it&#39;ll be over soon.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You can&#39;t maintain the Bounded Field anymore...This is the end.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...Yes. With so many parts of the theater destroyed, I have no choice but to yield.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> However, I&#39;d like to ask one thing. Consider it a final tribute to the defeated.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –What?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> It&#39;s fine to hone your strength and become a king. Even if the rule you impose is tyrannical.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> However...How can you act without raising one eyebrow?</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m not trying to cast doubt on your conscience. You&#39;re not enjoying this in the first place.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You&#39;re neither a king rewarded by the smiles of your people, nor one striving for your dream.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> What exactly do you seek, then?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I seek nothing. I don&#39;t need rewards. I don&#39;t even hope for a place to rest at my destination.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> This is how I am. I merely charge forward until exhausted.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You could say, if anything,wherever my corpse lies is my destination.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...How absurd. You&#39;ve decided to live as a king,yet you have no interest in gaining anything as a king.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> You are mistaken. Those contradict each other. The only path for you is to abandon one or the other, Cú Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I see. But in reality, as you see here, I&#39;m the victor and you&#39;re the vanquished.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Now die, Emperor of Rome.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –It matters not if I&#39;m torn to pieces. “Gáe Bolg! ”</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> Ugh...How disappointing...It seems my performance ends here—</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What a pleasant feeling. That pierced not just your heart, but also all your other organs too.</p><p><strong>Nero Bride:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry, Lancer. I wanted to...Sing together with you...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I see it&#39;s over. Now, all that&#39;s left is that Servant named Robin.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You make it sound like there&#39;s a survivor. Press the attack and crush them.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yup!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Cú?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Over there.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This is the designated place.... Master!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hm, Robin Hood&#39;s fighting. All right, let&#39;s head over quickly!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sorry, I ended up running into them along the way!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> H-Hey! So what exactly happened out there!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well...Here&#39;s the gist of it...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s about it.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Geronimo, Billy, and even Nero...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...That idiot...We finally got to be summoned in the same era by some miracle...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Sorry, I&#39;ll be over there for a while.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Sure...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Still, it&#39;s impressive that you managed to escape such a situation. Did you use some sort of trick?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I would never have managed to pull it off alone. There was a Servant who lent me a hand.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A hand?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Tch...So persistent!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That goes for us both. I&#39;m sorry, but I must shoot you down.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Your bow isn&#39;t graceful enough. As a fellow Archer, allow me to teach you a few things.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Hm!?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> –Weak, so weak.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> You&#39;re well-trained, but you don&#39;t put any heart into your attacks. You&#39;re like a child throwing sticks.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Who are you? I pride myself in putting my full might behind that attack.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I have no obligation to answer. Just remember me as a god-slayer who happened to pass by.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I&#39;ve decided to allow that boy to escape with his life. Now withdraw, youngster who was merely adored by gods.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Being told that doesn&#39;t compel me to withdraw.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –No, stand down, Arjuna. That woman is too much even for you to handle.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you, you&#39;re in the way. If you&#39;re around, you&#39;re just going to get hurt.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Or what? Are you trying to hold me back? Does that mean you&#39;re a traitor, too?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Understood.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Good, good. Listening to others is a good thing. A good child, unlike you, Sétanta.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Quit calling me by my childhood name. What a headache. To think even you were summoned here.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong></p><p>Those are my lines, fool. That&#39;s not how you speak to your mentor.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But I&#39;ve always been like this.... So? Are you my enemy?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Why yes. You know how it goes...</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> If you see a rabid dog in your favorite flower garden, you wouldn&#39;t just sit around reading, would you?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I can&#39;t bear to see the fool you&#39;ve become. Though a fool, you&#39;re still my student. I should behead you out of mercy.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Now, answer me, Cú Chulainn. What has possessed you?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> No need to answer, huh?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> In that case, the only thing left for us to do is fight to the death...However, it seems the circumstances won&#39;t allow us to.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> I must allow that pale...boy in green to escape. You have that burden named Medb behind you.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> If we fight, things won&#39;t end well for either of them. So what&#39;ll it be, O king who gained a queen?</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Lose everything here, and promptly lighten your burden?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You must be joking. Knowing you, you&#39;d take Medb out the second we start this fight.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Of course. I can&#39;t stand that woman. So I might just impale her with the best thrust of my life.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> We won&#39;t fight here. I&#39;ll let that Archer go.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Now you will get out of my sight, too. Come back again when everyone has died off, so no one can stand in our way.</p><p><strong>D：???:</strong><br> Very well, that would be my duty anyway. When you no longer have a way to die, I&#39;ll kill you with a smile.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...A shield rune to escape from the battlefield, huh?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Not going after them?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> She&#39;s not someone who&#39;d go down so easily. She can handle even a thousand spears I throw her way.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I can&#39;t win unless I&#39;m ready to die. When I fight her again, it will be when there&#39;s no one left to kill.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Robin, the woman who you said saved you...If she&#39;s Cú Chulainn&#39;s mentor, then she...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I&#39;m right here. Is this some sort of far-seeing spell? I can&#39;t say it&#39;s in good taste. Poor disposition, too.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> N-Nice to meet you, too...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I should introduce myself. My name is Scáthach. Although I&#39;m sure some of you already realized that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Scáthach! Mentor of Cú Chulainn, and guardian of the Land of Shadows!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –Yes, that&#39;s right. Oh, needless to say, I&#39;m different from the other Celtic Servants.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Perhaps it&#39;s because I am a special being beyond human, that Grail cannot rule over me.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> The reason I materialized as a Heroic Spirit is a special one, too. All of humanity was incinerated, as was my realm.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> And so, being “dead,” I was summoned here. In a proper version of history, I wouldn&#39;t even be able to talk to the living.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> From that perspective, I&#39;m glad about the current incident in a way, but...No, there&#39;s nothing to be glad about.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> My student was already foolish enough, but now I see him in an even more unsightly, idiotic form.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I came here to put a collar on him and take him back, but it seems there&#39;s something on his mind as well.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I considered putting an end to everything, including this era, but then I saw you.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> This war isn&#39;t something that Heroic Spirits should settle. It must be solved by human hands.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That Archer, a part of the cause, was in a dilemma. I couldn&#39;t bear not to lend aid.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yes, you seem rather ordinary, but...There is strength in your eyes. A good Master, isn&#39;t that right, Mash?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, thank you very much. I&#39;m proud of my Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, Scáthach. Would you fight alongside us?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That&#39;d be difficult. I can lend a hand, but I can&#39;t join you.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> As I said before, I don&#39;t have the means of repairing this era. All I can do is kill.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Also...I doubt I could win against THAT Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-What!? You&#39;re Cú Chulainn&#39;s mentor. And even you can&#39;t win...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;m shocked myself. Nothing can be more irritating.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That is the Cú Chulainn I know,and at the same time he isn&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> It&#39;s likely because of Medb&#39;s wish upon the Grail. She wanted the fool to become a wicked king rivaling herself.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> As a result, a cursed warrior with nothing but the power to become a king was born.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> A Fanged God, or a Mad King, covered from head to toe in spines of death. That is the current Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Pitiful.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Most pitiful. That thing is painful. The fool felt even one thorn unmanageable, so he must be out of his mind with a thousand.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But by paying such a price, he has surpassed me. They say an idiot without hesitation is strong, yes?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That isn&#39;t strength. It&#39;s simply confining one&#39;s life inside a cage.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s called failure. Dreams that don&#39;t reach outside are nothing but delusions.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Indeed. Either way, this isn&#39;t just a matter of defeating Cú Chulainn alone.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Considering overall damage, Queen Medb has priority. The Holy Grail must be taken from that woman.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t expect much from me. I&#39;d destroy the Holy Grail along with Medb, but that puts you back at square one.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You&#39;re right...If the Grail is destroyed, repairing the Foundation of Humanity would be difficult.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That would be a huge time loss for us. If possible, we need to recover the Grail intact.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Let&#39;s consider Lady Scáthach to be our last resort. I want you guys to try defeating Medb by yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Medb...The legendary queen of the Celts.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yes. She&#39;s a woman who is honest about her own desires. She&#39;s just engrossed in taking over a nation at the moment.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That woman, along with Cú Chulainn...Those two alone are enough to take any nation.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yet they also have Arjuna. And...I suppose Beowulf is still alive as well.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> He&#39;s rather capricious, so we have no idea what he would do. But it&#39;s certain that he would side with the enemy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ???Doesn&#39;t it seem a bit noisy around us?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Hey! They&#39;re coming to attack us. What should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Intercept them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold our ground.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Yes. I&#39;m super angry right now. I&#39;ll strangle them all myself!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-We should go, too. We must retain this camp as the front line for the West!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Wyverns, huh...They&#39;ll be difficult for those machines to handle.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Fujimaru, come with me. I&#39;d like to see your talents.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I don&#39;t see any Servants with them. Overcome this situation first.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Got it.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yes, good answer. Now on your way!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Not bad, but how about the next ones?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Wyverns and Chimeras? Curse you, Medb, summoning things like this.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Land and air.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Servants must understand their own roles and the Master must provide appropriate commands to kill those off.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Trouble won&#39;t be tolerated. Now go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Next are high ranking warriors among the Celts. Although they&#39;ve given up their humanity.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> They&#39;re as swift and strong as Servants. But if you have trouble here, you&#39;ll never reach Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Know your Servants, and use them well. Don&#39;t disappoint me, understand?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hm...Shadow Servants have appeared. That Medb seems to understand how to use the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> These are wraiths that couldn&#39;t become Servants. They are one step shy of becoming heroes.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Or they are Heroic Spirits that became shadows due to the summoners&#39; lack of ability, improper summoning circles, etc.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Thus, you could say they&#39;re beings closest to Servants. Make sure to defeat them. Humans stand no chance against them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Hm?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> —Haaah!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wh-What&#39;s that!? The black things are disappearing one after another!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...A Servant. However, not a Celtic one. He seems to be from near my country...Chinese perhaps?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He doesn&#39;t look like an enemy. But...is he...an ally?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –Regardless, his technique is quite impressive.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Abilities like that are impossible without both innate talent and hellish training to forge one&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Excellent. Most excellent. It makes me itch for a good fight.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You there! What is your name!?</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Lancer, Li Shuwen! Well met, Servant of twin spears!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> A storm has been raging within me ever since I caught sight of you. It will not subside until I defeat you. Accept my challenge!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –Oh? You challenge me?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Naturally. I know the reason why I was summoned.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Still...I can&#39;t help it. I&#39;m filled with selfishness, after all.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I must try and see if my spear can reach the gods.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This man is like a famished tiger, or a starving wolf...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...What a great potential playthi– Ahem...I mean, talent worth training.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Lancer, Li Shuwen. If this was the Land of Shadows, I&#39;d train you right away.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> However, I belong to Fujimaru&#39;s cause already. Thus, things must be done in order.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> First fight Mash, and win. If you do, I, Scáthach, shall face you directly.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> However, if defeated, you must be gone immediately.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...I see, I understand. Very well, Mash. I hereby challenge you to a duel.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...I don&#39;t have any reason to fight.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I am confronting you. Is that not reason enough?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> If that&#39;s still insufficient, then consider me as a Servant sided with the Celts.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We have to fight.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> He&#39;s an enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Yes, I see your Master has good judgment. That&#39;s right, I am your enemy. That should be beyond a doubt.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> If you don&#39;t treat me as such–you&#39;ll die.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I understand...Master! Please provide your orders!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-He is...really strong!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s my line. To think you&#39;d stand so well against me...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> If we were to fight seriously, to the death,I have no idea which way the scales would tip...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Scáthach, I&#39;d like to rescind my previous request.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Oh, is that okay?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> All of you perhaps stand a chance against those Celts.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I may be a scoundrel detached from society, but even I don&#39;t enjoy watching the world fall to ruin.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You who&#39;s not human...Protect this world with that shield of yours.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I will.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Now then, Scáthach. I have a request. Regardless of whether this world is saved or not–</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Would you face me at the end?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Very well. That is, if I survive until the time comes.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> You don&#39;t seem like one who would die so easily.... Oh right, I have one more thing to tell you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> This is simply my inference, but it seems the King of Inventions is possessed by something.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Perhaps a good whack in the head will wake him up from his endless dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...Li Shuwen? Would you care to fight alongside us—</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t say with confidence that I wouldn&#39;t attack you if I continued to be around you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> If I was in my older body, I may have withered and settled down a bit. But I can&#39;t help it, as I was summoned in my physical prime.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Why, fate allowing, we may yet fight alongside each other. Farewell.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And he&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> As expected of Li Shuwen in his prime. So rough, he&#39;s like a knife that cuts you just by touching it...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Master, if I may, I believe I should go and see the patient.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What patient?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who&#39;s that?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Edison, King of Inventions.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> According to what that Servant said,he is supposedly possessed by something.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I agree with his opinion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Even considering my knowledge as a Servant, that being is too foreign in nature to say he&#39;s Edison, King of Inventions.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In that case, it must be an illness. We should meet with him again.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Things are starting to sound crazy again...He captured you before, yet you want to meet him again?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I believe so, too. However–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What are you saying? There are many infected areas. In situations like this, triage is important.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, what should we do?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go see Edison.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Right. I think that&#39;s the correct thing to do, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess it&#39;s my intuition as a Servant...I feel like we can&#39;t leave him like this.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Then we should go. Immediately. We&#39;ll head straight there.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Charge via the shortest route.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We need to knock that hard-headed man out with some anesthesia, then wake him up.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hm...Robin, Elisabeth, Rama.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You&#39;ve heard your Master&#39;s opinion. What do you think?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Well, to be honest, my head hurts so much I&#39;d like some anesthesia myself...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;ll leave the decision to Fujimaru. Everything until now has been right, so I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be fine going forward.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hmm...I&#39;m a Servant who&#39;s better off acting alone. And besides, that...presi-king, was it?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Why would I take the effort to meet someone I know I&#39;d be incompatible with just by how you describe him?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Are you saying you&#39;ll just casually go and assassinate Cú Chulainn for us?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I don&#39;t do crazy things like that. As long as there are other means, at least.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If you can&#39;t do it, just say so. You just can&#39;t honestly admit things, can you?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...To think you of all people would tell me that. I should probably just shut my mouth and go along with it.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I have faith in our Master. If we all stand together, we can even defeat Karna if needed.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Now, Master.

Why do you ask? Do you torture people too?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> No way! An interrogation, if anything!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If we want to get to Edison&#39;s stronghold nonstop, we&#39;ll need prisoners like them.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Prisoners? Why? There&#39;s no use for them other than relieving my headache.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Geez. You&#39;ve gotten a little more decent, but you&#39;re still the same at the root.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Oh well, whatever. Anyway, just hold back a bit, that&#39;s all I&#39;m asking.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really get it, but okay! Now, let&#39;s go, my little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Whew. We made it through the battle just fine. We also captured some retreating enemies.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Robin, what should we do from here?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right, tie them up...There.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Now&#39;s the time for me to get to work. You all go elsewhere and eat a meal or something.</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Halt right there.

We&#39;ve captured some enemy soldiers, and they&#39;re to be transferred to headquarters!</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> –Understood and confirmed.

Please continue through.</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Industry and...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Domination! I&#39;ll continue with my duties now.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right then. All of you, follow me.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Uh, Robin? What was that greeting just now? Are you into stuff like that?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t wanna do it, either! That&#39;s the salute among mechanized troops! I had no choice!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Domination...Is Mr. Edison, well, perhaps a bad guy?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> No. He&#39;s a little problematic, but he&#39;s probably got a different grasp of the word “domination. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Citizens coming together as one to overcome hardship. Perhaps he thinks of that as “domination. ”</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t domination for one&#39;s own vanity, but a call to action done for the sake of this nation.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Interesting. I heard he was an inventor, but it seems he had political potential as well.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Still, those soldiers were unsatisfactory. They weren&#39;t trained at all. That&#39;s beyond foolish!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Yeah. By simplifying the thought process, he&#39;s trying to improve their reflexes.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> By losing individual instinct and senses, they become tools of automation, completing a single task in large numbers...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Also, it&#39;s conceivable they&#39;re administering drugs for suppressing fear and doubt. It happens often, but I worry about the aftereffects.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Edison doesn&#39;t have the time to raise soldiers, or should I say warriors.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s why he came up with a way for anyone to easily become a soldier.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s a doctrine of mass production and united thoughts...The exact opposite of the Celts.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That said, their opponents are heroes of legend. If this was a modern war, Edison would likely win, but...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hm...The Celts are disregarding their rear from the get-go anyway.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...In fact, it&#39;s not like the Celtic warriors are using much in the way of intelligence...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Generally, they&#39;re muscleheads. Muscleheads versus machines...Yes, they&#39;re brilliantly equal in disposition.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Suppressing fear with drugs, huh...Sounds like this side isn&#39;t very decent, either.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I shouldn&#39;t have hesitated about this. Let&#39;s go straight to our target.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Let&#39;s take down this self-proclaimed king ASAP!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Whaaaat!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Don&#39;t misunderstand. We&#39;re not going to take him down, we&#39;re going to treat him.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Although, I can&#39;t deny that the treatment procedure may be violent, even quite painful–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But in the end, that&#39;s still treatment.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I got it, just don&#39;t shoot a gun near my ear again!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take it into consideration. Anyway, we should head to Edison&#39;s stronghold–but first...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It&#39;s gradual, but Edison&#39;s side is being overwhelmed. We should proceed after treating some Celtic warriors.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That enemy looks like a Bicorn.

What part of me is ill?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> These strong limbs. This sound body, bursting with health. This sharp and honed intellect.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Everywhere you look, it&#39;s so standard!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Be quiet. What&#39;s so rude about telling a patient that they&#39;re ill?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If you want to be pampered, go ask your mother or wife.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You have the power to save the world, yet you&#39;re trying to bring the world to ruin.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> How is that anything but an illness?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> You&#39;re wrong!

I&#39;ll remember that, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Forget it.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> O-Okay, I&#39;ll forget it.... So that&#39;s no good?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We don&#39;t have time for idle chat. –Now, we must break through.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> –So you&#39;ve come.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Of course, Karna.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You&#39;re also ill. Withdraw at once, you shouldn&#39;t be here.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There&#39;s something you desire, after all. I recommend recuperation in a remote place.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...You might be correct. I&#39;m infected by an illness called loyalty.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Instantly realizing what I desire...Is that due to your occupation as a nurse?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, you&#39;re simply easy to understand.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ......I see.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, Karna seems somewhat depressed.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> –Thank you for pointing that out. However, I cannot surrender this path to you.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> The King of Inventions asked for my aid, after all. He kneeled before a worthless man like me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> He was the first to ask. That&#39;s more than enough reason to oppose you.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Also, one more thing. Edison resembles a friend of mine.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> A man clever, yet foolish. Proud, yet full of charity.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> There was once a king who called me friend. A king who saved me.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Edison resembles that amiable man well. To put it simply, I cannot leave him be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> —How surprising. To think someone like you could smile like that.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Even I&#39;m human. I have emotions, like any ordinary person. However, that&#39;s enough talk.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> The first time was testing the waters. This is the second. Show me just how much you have improved—!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hah...Hah...Hah...Y-You&#39;re good!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Stand back. You&#39;re at your limit. Umm...Redhorn?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Oh shut up! Some things I just can&#39;t give up as a fellow Lancer!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Lancer!? Weren&#39;t you an idol?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;m taking a break from my idol activities. Right now, I don&#39;t have a choice, so I&#39;m holding this spear!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Mm. Return? What an odd order.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> But—I see, He wants to decide with his own hands. That&#39;s rather arrogant, but perhaps it cannot be helped.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What? Are you running away!?

Earlier we were speaking over the comms, but I imagine Edison wants to speak in person.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Regardless, it looks like we can&#39;t avoid battle before talking to him.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...True. I don&#39;t think Edison will come around unless he is knocked down once.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Let&#39;s get things ready first, Master. Then we&#39;ll head out.</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Now–entering!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> How dare you come here! You reprehensible traitors!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Why can you not believe in my righteousness? Are you drowning in conspiracy theories?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Like “Edison was the embodiment of capitalism itself! ”and “True geniuses do not idolize business! ”</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mr. Edison. I believe you&#39;re the one easily swayed by conspiracy theories.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> While I have not sensed a sliver of intelligence from you, I do know that your inventions are indeed amazing.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Which is why I have diagnosed that you are ill based on something other than such rumors.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Argh! I have no idea what kind of nonsense that is! Nightingale, pioneer of statistics!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Why did you materialize as a Berserker? I have no intention of speaking to an unintelligent beast!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Well, aren&#39;t you a beast yourself? I mean, you&#39;re a lion...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Sigh. Your fever is indeed getting to you. What a waste of intelligence.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Mmm!? Lady Nightingale, what did you just call me!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Pardon me. Slip of the tongue.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Master. Please prepare to operate. First, we need to have him rest on the bed, and make him hear what we have to say.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You&#39;re rather aggressive, Florence. Are you implying you&#39;re going to fight him and win?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes, I doubt he&#39;ll listen to us any other way. So we&#39;ll fight, we&#39;ll punch, and we&#39;ll win.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I like stuff like that. Very straightforward.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I don&#39;t like fighting...Nor am I good at it. But I suppose I can set aside those feelings for now.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Mr. Edison, are you ready?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Y-Yes!? Yes, I&#39;m ready. I&#39;ll engage them with all the electricity available!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Then they will truly know...How amazing inventions from this King of Inventions are–!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Direct current is just the way to go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...So you still ARE fixated about that!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Ooooooooh! Not yet...I have not lost yet! I will not surrender!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> If I do not suffice as a soldier, then I shall give up this body of mine to science!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Time for Thomas&#39; great transformation, the big remodeling! I shall cast away this humanoid gentleman&#39;s form!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Now it&#39;s time for a beastly boost! I&#39;ll transform into Thomas Mazda Edison—</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Gah!? Wh-What was that for, Karna? How dare you throw my superhuman elixir on the floor!?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Sorry, Edison. But this ends here...I cannot let you walk the path of destruction any further.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Besides, first and foremost,that medicine is bad for your body.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> No! Good medicine is always bitter to the taste. I can withstand my heart exploding! I&#39;ll show you!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> If I don&#39;t hold my ground here,who is going to protect this nation!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Protect, you say? For someone trying to protect, you have a rather illogical method of fighting.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What...D-Did you just call me...illogical?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes. Extremely illogical.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I am always logical! Both this nation and I are children of logic.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It can&#39;t possibly be illogical–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...We can&#39;t win.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Those Celts are monsters who spend all their time fighting, from birth to death.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> People of this era are already falling behind, right at the starting line.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Moreover, the revered Queen Medb possesses the Holy Grail, allowing her to create soldiers infinitely.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s why we can&#39;t win. There&#39;s simply no way to win.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The Holy Grail is the only resource they need to reinforce their army. The idea of strength in numbers was a mistake to begin with.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But you didn&#39;t let up your ground. Rather, you didn&#39;t want to give up that system.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Because—</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Mass production. Cheaper, more efficient production. That was what you, Thomas Edison, were ingenious at.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But those aesthetics strip you of the intelligence you originally had.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You thought, “I cannot lose on my home turf. ”And subconsciously, you got worked up over it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> And because you kept grumbling like that,you were corrupted by such an illness.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Erm...W-Well, but...But...Why...I cannot deny that...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> True, I was fixated on productivity. Even if we run out of resources, as long as we obtain victory at the end...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Indeed. There&#39;s no point winning in just the field of productivity. BUT! MOST! OF! ALL!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The biggest mistake is your body itself!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There are no records that indicate Edison had the head of a lion.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Furthermore, it is impossible for you to have such strength.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That means you possess power that doesn&#39;t belong to you. That is the dream pushing you to become “king. ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...isn&#39;t that the Holy Grail?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No. It is not the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The Holy Grail can only grant wishes. It does not manifest them.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Edison. Your own desire did not stem from yourself.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right. My name is Thomas Alva Edison.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I am the Presi-king of the United States of America. Past, present, and future...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The successive presidents of this nation granted me power. Because it was logical.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> They came to the conclusion that even if they were all summoned as Servants, they would lose to the Celts.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So, why not concentrate all the power into a single person. Not a president, but a hero with international fame.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...They entrusted me with the future known as “America! ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The presidents...from the first to the last.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Or rather, the thoughts of those who took up the mantle of president, or what you could call their grudges, had possessed him?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is the illness. For us, it&#39;s not just about America.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> We must heal, we must save this world. That is our Order.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> E pluribus unum.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You are a state made up of many races, equivalent to being children of many nations.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Which is why you have an obligation to save the world.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yet you divert your eyes and try to save only your own nation–that is why Edison suffers.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hrng...Guh...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is also why–you were defeated by Nikola Tesla, your fellow inventor.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Gaohoooooooooooooo!?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> (She landed the heaviest blow—! )</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> (...I wish you pulled your punches...)</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I-Is he okay? Mr. Edison, are you alive?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> GAFU...GAFUUU!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes, he has a pulse, but barely. He&#39;s on the ground, but he is still twitching, so...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> He will live. Edison, answer me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What is it you want to do?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Urgh...Mm...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Yes. I admit it, Florence Nightingale.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The successive kings granted me power, but logically that also pointed to the fact that I couldn&#39;t win...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I have strayed from my path just a little...It seems I was wandering in a maze of foolish thoughts.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Just a little...Just a little bit, was it...Very well.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> To heal an illness, one must first admit that he is ill.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Being lost is fine. Because right now, you have returned to the starting point.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I see...Despite all the sacrifices the citizens have made...I am now only at the starting line...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This is rough...This is actually rough. What am I supposed to do now...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Huh? You mean you don&#39;t know, Edison?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Blavatsky...Are you suggesting you do? What I should be doing?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Simple. Do what you would always do. If you fail 3,000 times, you try again with attempt number 3,001.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You&#39;re never discouraged by failure, causing trouble for all those around you. You always find a way to get back up.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s your life. Right, Thomas Alva Edison?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> In the end...That was your ultimate talent, right?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Blavatsky...I am not sure if I should take that as a compliment or insult...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But thank you. You really are my friend. I just need to overcome it...That was my life&#39;s conclusion.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But I&#39;m a loser. A coward. The King of Lawsuits. Leading a nation again is something I can&#39;t possibly—</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> That&#39;s not true. Make no mistake, Edison.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> You were lost, but you were headed towards the correct location.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Saving someone you don&#39;t know the name of, or trying to shine light into a world of darkness...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I can confidently say that those are desires you can be proud of.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> No matter how much you blame yourself, or how much you hate yourself, or how you perform evil deeds out of being overly cautious...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Unlike heroes who can only save others by defeating something, you do it and have done it with your inventions.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> As in, not with your words.... Ultimately, you really became a light shining onto the world.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Feed off that hope, that accomplishment, and stand up. You&#39;re at rock bottom right now, but not all is lost, right?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Karna—</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Mmm. It is time to wake up, great King of Inventions. There are still so many gems hidden in that brain of yours.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...I see. Your world is far from seeing inventions, and vastly differs from mine, yet you still say that.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Babbage, my best friend, is telling me in Morse code...That I cannot lose until I am bankrupt.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> In that case...Yes! The presi-king will never die! He must rise as often as needed!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The dream of bringing prosperity to the world has revived! Karna, Blavatsky! Sorry to have caused you trouble!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;re friends.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...Right. Though a bit pushy, after coming this far, I suppose we are friends.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> —Ha. I&#39;m always blessed with such great friends.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even that hysteric can&#39;t match me here. This is what I can call my own fortune.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...I also owe you an apology and my thanks,Fujimaru. And to all you Servants who support [♂ him /♀ her].</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Frankly, I still have no idea. I still don&#39;t know how to save the world, or how to defeat the Celts.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. Let&#39;s think about it together.</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I am grateful, and I&#39;m counting on you. That&#39;s right, I have forgotten something very important!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> The president always has a vice president by his side. At times, the VP is even more capable.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mr. Edison, then you mean...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes. I am Thomas Alva Edison. One cornerstone of the foundation for American prosperity.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> In that case, this time for sure...I want to create an invention that will save this world!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Of course, as your Servant, Fujimaru!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It would be my pleasure!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! That&#39;s great news, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So I&#39;ve been appointed VP!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Ahh, congratulations! Though, that role usually dies first in movies!</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> —I will now bestow myself and all that I have upon you, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Will you save the world together with me? ...My Master.</p><h2 id="section-16-the-fellowship" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-16-the-fellowship" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 16: The Fellowship</h2><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Now, everyone, have a seat! We&#39;re gonna brainstorm, guys!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, teacher! Me, me!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes, Elisabeth. What is it?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> We invade, and beat them up. That&#39;s our only choice!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s...Completely denied!!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whyyyyyyy!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I know! How about we sing to heal their souls?</p><p><strong>Everyone:</strong><br> DENIED!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whyyyyyyy!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> They lack the refinement to appreciate it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They have no tolerance for such things.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I-I see. Then I suppose there&#39;s nothing we can do.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> One needs knowledge to understand music, too. If they don&#39;t have that, there&#39;s nothing I can do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We need to wait for death metal to be invented.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Right, if death metal was– What&#39;d you just say, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Idols! My genre of choice is a cutesy pop idol song, you know?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This is what&#39;s known as “letting 100 schools of thought contend,” yes? Anyway, all of you, please reassess the current situation.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Here&#39;s a map. The Celts occupy the eastern half of North America.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> They&#39;ll ultimately invade us from two routes, north and south. They&#39;re currently making the preparations to do so.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> If we were to invade, we would leave one side exposed. They&#39;d overwhelm us, and we&#39;d lose.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Based on data obtained so far, losing too much land will likely be the condition for defeat in this war.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So I presume.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The connection to the era is fragile enough as is, it will sever more as the Celts expand their area of dominance.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In time, this era will no longer withstand its separation from reality...and it will “die. ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> So, even if we do invade, we have to make sure they don&#39;t take any more of our current territory.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s how it was...Then the fact that I increased the number of troops and pushed back the front line as a stopgap measure...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Ended up saving this nation, yes. The patient was continuously losing stamina, but you protected its heart.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes...Yes!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But, that was also your limit. You slightly pushed back the front line, but it won&#39;t be long before it falls.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Servants will likely be commanding the invading army.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> At this rate...the mechanized infantry won&#39;t stand a chance, and they&#39;ll continue to branch out.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But that was then, right? Now we have a bunch of Servants!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Well, there is some truth to what Eli-Eli is saying. Hmm...Let&#39;s first look at our opponents&#39; strength–</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Queen Medb, Cú Chulainn, Beowulf, Arjuna...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> We may outnumber them, but they have some of the world&#39;s greatest heroes on their side...Not just Celtic ones.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Add to that the Celtic soldiers, who can overwhelm even Servants if there are enough.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> And don&#39;t forget the monsters and Shadow Servants they pull into the confusion.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> To top it off, they can reproduce indefinitely. Can we defeat them? I can&#39;t. Totally impossible.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Mmm, hmm...I could keep up at full strength, but–</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Defeat? That I cannot guarantee.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Even if we were to just go after the Servants...I mean, I&#39;ll do it if you ask me to.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;d be beaten to a pulp if it&#39;s one-on-one. If only there was someone else to help...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Mmm...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Now, then...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t good...The discussion is coming to a halt. How about we move our bodies a little bit?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Fujimaru! You should take this opportunity to join us!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This is a virtual skirmish I invented. It&#39;s only slightly dangerous!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Physical activity relaxes the mind,but in the end, there are only two ways to go about this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is one of them...assassination?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> A select few will go to Washington D. C. , and assassinate Queen Medb.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That should prevent any further increase in Celtic soldiers. We can turn this into a fight between Servants.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But Medb is extremely cautious.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Once she senses Servants, she will likely bring all her Servants back at once.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> To be honest, she&#39;s already survived one assassination attempt. I would expect her to be even more cautious.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That really hits home.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Painfully true. What do you think,Chief Nurse Nightingale? Quite the pickle, isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I shall leave military problems of this sort to you. I am just a nurse.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Now, don&#39;t say that.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;m telling you that I&#39;m useless. Sheesh...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> If an ambush is impossible, we fight them head-on. That&#39;s about all I can think up right now.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hmm...Actually, Nightingale&#39;s suggestion is probably the most realistic one.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Meaning?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> We place mechanized infantry and Servants both to the north and south.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Of the two armies, one simply needs to hold its ground. Meanwhile, the main army will rush towards the capital.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...What do you say, Scáthach?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. There are several Servants here.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Some Servants are powerful enough to rival the enemy, myself included. However, there aren&#39;t enough for “two even armies. ”</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But if we concentrate forces into one army, the other will crumble, and the enemy will occupy America.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> All types of balance must be considered when forming the North and South armies.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Now, how to handle it...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What, that&#39;s actually quite simple!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Mmm?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Come on, little [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] over there! Don&#39;t just stand around, you pick the parties!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Um, me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you sure?</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Naturally. You fought alongside Servants in France, Rome, and all sorts of other places, right?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No other Master in the world is as familiar with Servants as you are.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If you choose the teams,I can trust those decisions!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Oh, Eli-Eli has a point.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Can you stop calling me Eli-Eli!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hmm, it&#39;s just like Elisabeth says. If Master selects the parties, I will be all right with it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Give me some time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Hold on a sec.</p><hr><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> No problem. Just think of a team of Servants by tomorrow.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> In the meantime, Edison and his team should prepare for the final battle.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Sounds like a plan. Start up the comms! Inform all units immediately!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Senpai. It&#39;s a lot of responsibility, but we&#39;re counting on you.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sleep on it for a day, if you need to. I believe you&#39;ve got it in you!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Taking a walk at this hour?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Change of pace.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...This is also some sort of fate. I shall accompany you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Edison&#39;s wounds are healed. His responsibilities as King of America should&#39;ve been lessened.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Or perhaps the obsessions of past presidents had been possessing him.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There is a chance for a poor prognosis, so I need to continue monitoring him...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> One illness left. I only hope then the world will be healed.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll try my best.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Yeah, we have to make it work.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I have no intention of putting you under any pressure. I hope you don&#39;t misunderstand.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Normally, it&#39;s insane to have just one person bear the responsibilities of stopping world destruction.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is indeed a dire move. Only the insane could withstand the pressure.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Like I once was.... But you are different.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You must remain steadfast and assign us to our posts.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I trust you. The same way I trust my comrades who fought against the stubborn army.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You need to make an effort. But there is no need to bear the entire burden.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Moreover, even if your choice is correct,there is the possibility that we, the entrusted, will fail.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Even with utmost preparations,soldiers will die, and people will fall ill.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> So, I hope you do not shoulder too much weight.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Relax, but be honest–I&#39;m sure we will be fine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Do you find the night breeze a bit chilly? Let&#39;s return.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The fallen soldiers are on the move. If we leave them alone, their numbers will only increase.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> A corpse is a mound of pathogens. We must carefully mourn them, and send them to the afterlife!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Now, let&#39;s head over to heal our wounded hero.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> My oh my...Even he is but an ill patient to you.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I would&#39;ve never guessed that you, his mentor, had failed to notice.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I am not good at dealing with illness. After all, having come this close to being a Divine Spirit, illness has lost its meaning to me.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> A straightforward death is something I&#39;ve long since left behind.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t understand. For one who has traversed death, your expression seems glum?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But of course. I have not traversed death. Simply, I have overcome it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yet that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve transcended death. I am merely a ghost who was left behind by life.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> What of yourself? In the sense of ghosts or grudges, I believe you&#39;re rather close to me?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I have simply returned to the present world in my peak form. Which is why I shall treat anyone to the best of my ability.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The fact that I was summoned in itself shows that this world is still in need of “nursing. ”</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hmm...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> First, the North Army. Elisabeth, Robin, Edison, and Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Then, the South Army. Karna, Rama, Nightingale, Fujimaru, Mash, and myself.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> The North Army might just be barely enough to hold them. However, depending on the enemy&#39;s number, the South Army can break through their defense.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;ll equip boosters on the mechanized infantry for the South Army so they can keep up with you Servants.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hold the North with as few members as possible, and rush into Washington D. C. with the South Army.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Wait a minute, [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet]! I want to get at him, too!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;m counting on you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You&#39;re the only one.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ......Fine.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> In exchange, Cú Chulainn, the one who defeated Saber...Make sure to take him down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Understood.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I promise you.</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Fine then. I&#39;ll fight for you here, along with that Mr. Komadori.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s not my actual name, you know? Well, you can leave this side to us.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> If we&#39;re against an army, my preparations will come in handy. I&#39;ll do a thorough job of harassing them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yes. Our goal is 60% reduction. I&#39;m sure you can do that much.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Against Celtic warriors led by Servants? That&#39;ll require double as much work as usual...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Oh, you can do it with only double? That&#39;s amazing, Hermit of the Forest. You&#39;ve exceeded my expectations.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Ugh, I talked too fast. Normally, it&#39;s impossible even with double the effort...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Maybe if we put our lives on the line, we might make it work. We&#39;ll give it our best shot.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> They are counting on us.</p><p>I&#39;m just not sure how far we can go with two Casters...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> However, I&#39;ll do my best. No matter what the job is, I will see it through.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Mmm. We might&#39;ve gone down the wrong path, but I&#39;m glad my mechanized infantry can be of use.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Allow me to take charge of the North Army.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> No one has any issue with this? Then let&#39;s move everybody out.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> This is quite a large-scale operation. I imagine our opponents will pick up on our movements.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> We have to time our attacks simultaneously. Three days from now, at dusk.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Servants in the North Army should move out at once. We must expect the unexpected.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> True. I trust you with this mission, Madame Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Indeed. Mr. Edison, I wish you the best, as well.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Karna!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> What is it, Edison?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Um, well. I&#39;ve been meaning to say this, but didn&#39;t get the chance to!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Thank you for answering the request of someone like me! I was able to come this far because you were with us!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Don&#39;t mention it, Edison, and Godspeed.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Thank you, Karna. Now, Master!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...I imagine I won&#39;t be able to see you again. Though quite brief, you really treated me well.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You&#39;re a role model for children.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Oh, you&#39;re Edison...What can I say?</p><hr><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hah! Did you read a biography or something? If it was written for children, I must have been so awesome.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...I swear I will accomplish this mission, so the real me won&#39;t lose to the book me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Then, farewell, my friends!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> All right, guess we&#39;ll take off, too. This is our final farewell.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I suppose this is the life of someone engaged in guerrilla warfare. As long as we&#39;re alive, we&#39;ll meet again.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Not necessarily seeing each other face to face. For example a song or a letter left behind by someone...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;m saying we&#39;ll come across stuff like that if we survive. For humans, meeting in person isn&#39;t the only way to reunite.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> See ya. It was a short while. But I had fun.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...It doesn&#39;t bother me. Seems like we&#39;re strangely connected, anyway...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I&#39;ll probably be summoned into a different era anyway. I might already have a contract as a Servant to begin with.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way I would die. I am invincible.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Which is why...Well, as long as you avenge Nero, I&#39;ll be fine.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry. You&#39;ve got some potential as a Master.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! Why don&#39;t I write you a little song to cheer–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ahhh! My stomach! Can&#39;t hear you!</p><hr><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> –you up. You say you&#39;re sick but you look pretty energetic?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well, whatever...I plan to console the soldiers along the way!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We&#39;ve got a long road ahead...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> All right. Time for to head to the front lines. This is the final battle...Don&#39;t let your guard down.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Perfect! Why don&#39;t I find out if you&#39;re really up for the task...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-So suddenly–!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Hm, not bad for a practice round.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think I would be nearly killed in a warm-up...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Oh, nonsense. All right then, Rama, you lead the charge.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Huh? I don&#39;t mind, but...You&#39;re not going to do it?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take my leave here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!? W-Wait, why!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be acting on my own and monitoring the actions of Queen Medb and Cú Chulainn. If needed, I&#39;ll fight and hold them down.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t that like walking to your own death!?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Certainly, if I was some other Servant. But, who do you think I am?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Do I look like someone who&#39;d be gobbled up that easily? Even if they got me, it&#39;d take days.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Still, you already say it like it&#39;s inevitable...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Well. That can&#39;t be helped. There must be some sacrifices. After all, someone&#39;s got to do it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Listen. If those two ever make it to the front lines, we will most certainly lose.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I am something like a dam to hold them back. It&#39;s on you all to lead this battle to victory.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I am counting on you, Rama. You&#39;re still inexperienced, but you have the skill to be a swordsman comparable to my stupid student.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You have experience leading battles, too. You&#39;re essential in our army.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no stopping you after such a speech. In life, my army was mostly monkeys...But, well, it&#39;ll work out.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Fujimaru...Master. Don&#39;t look so worried.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You&#39;ve got plenty of Servants now. You have nothing to fear, even if I alone am missing.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Ideally, I would&#39;ve liked to enjoy the life of a normal Servant, but asking for luxuries can be endless.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Farewell!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Master, a word?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Karna. What is it?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to stand out as much as possible in the vanguard...Will you allow it?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Why?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I guess...</p><hr><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> –Arjuna is on the other side.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> By nature, he shouldn&#39;t be on that side.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> A born hero, Kiritin...Arjuna is the very embodiment of justice, a true Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> In addition, he and I are connected to each other...For better or for worse.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> The key to this battle lies in how we immobilize enemy Servants.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> In which case, I&#39;ll concentrate on shutting down Arjuna with everything I&#39;ve got...Would that be all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Please, Karna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Very well. I&#39;ll make sure to shut Arjuna down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Do your best.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Of course I will. I will not go easy on him.</p><hr><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I will take the vanguard soldiers, then. Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Karna leading the vanguard. Rama and Nightingale are here with us, too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yet...I am still worried. Despite being more supported than ever before—</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You have good reason to be, Mash. After all, Cú Chulainn is on their side.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> The strongest soldier, who singlehandedly fought his way through Medb&#39;s army.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> As long as he is against us,there will be no such thing as a sure victory for us.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I need not mention Edison and his North Army. We, too, may very well collapse on the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Nevertheless, to make victory ours...We will give it our all.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Now, Master. Your orders.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Aim for the White House!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Begin the advance!</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Understood! All units attack! This is the final battle!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Take back the United States of America for yourselves! We will lend our assistance as well!</p><h2 id="section-17-war" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-17-war" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 17: War</h2><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hey! Guess what, my king? They&#39;re dead. Fionn mac Cumhaill and Diarmuid.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Looks like the Servants turned the tables on them. You really can&#39;t underestimate them, can you?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Or, could it be that their Master is even stronger than we thought?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s nice.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> So apathetic. Not interested?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Of course not. The greatest benefit of a dead man is that you no longer have to think of him.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What interests me is what the living are up to.... Let&#39;s see. What do you think they&#39;re planning to do?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> I have a report.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Ah. Speak.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes sir. The United Western States Army split their troops to the north and south. The South Army is advancing towards us.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My, they want a final battle?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> They&#39;re bringing in troops standing by at the rear as well. No doubt about it.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> And leading the army is–</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> It&#39;s not Edison?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> No, Edison and Blavatsky are in charge of the North Army. The South Army is led by another Servant.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s more?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes. Leading the South Army is a young male Servant,and a Servant with a giant shield.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> We have also confirmed a nurse Servant.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Leading the vanguard is Karna–the thin Lancer with a shining spear.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> One, two, three...Four!? There are suddenly four more of them!?</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Karna&#39;s presence had been previously confirmed, but...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That still leaves three new Servants!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Probably more than three.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> My mentor, the Indian rascal, even the Servant I let escape once...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> On top of it, that shield Servant from the report...That means there must be more.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What, no way! Edison partnered up with those guys!?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...In other words, they gave up on giving up?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Looks like it.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> He gave up on protecting America,and instead decided to take the world for his own.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hmm, this might not be good, huh? You never know what can happen in an all-out war.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What to do?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Hey.</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> We&#39;re off to war. Gather troops.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> W-Wait...Are you planning on joining the fight!?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Of course. Are you planning on leaving them alone?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> No, no! In the name of the Mad King, I won&#39;t let them be. I&#39;ll crush those Servants with my entire army.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> By advancing on us, they insulted the king and provoked us. Then again, it just goes to show how desperate they are.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Desperate people are favorable for me.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The despair of those who hate us and spite us is so many shades darker than the ordinary kind, you see?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> An avenging father slain by his family&#39;s murderer, a lover killed by someone whose lover was also killed,</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I love stories like that. That&#39;s why I simply squash them, with my superior resources!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Let us divide our army into two forces as well.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Leave the North Army to Beowulf, and put Arjuna in charge of the South Army.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take care of informing the Servants. Now, go!</p><p><strong>Soldier:</strong><br> Yes!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Taking the scout&#39;s report into consideration, their main force is the South Army.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> They&#39;re planning to crush our forces with that army and march straight to the capital.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The North Army only needs to hold the front. At worst, they&#39;re buying time?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> My oh my...And they call themselves proud Servants?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That&#39;s just how desperate they are.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That Edison guy has cast aside his pride,and is trying to protect this world and fix history.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> The source is most likely–the world&#39;s last remaining Master that was in the reports.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Medb. How are you reading this?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Servants unleash their greatest powers when they have a Master.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If they come fighting not as individual troops,but as Servants accompanying their Master</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Is our army powerful enough to defeat them?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s see. It might be tough.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Beowulf and Arjuna are both top-notch warriors, but they have no will to fight.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You could say Arjuna has a reason to fight, although it&#39;s a very personal one.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But Beowulf is only barely following orders. I can&#39;t imagine him losing...but...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Medb. We&#39;re going all in.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> !!! O-Okay.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> But I need time. Setting the North aside, the South–</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll hold the South down.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Arjuna can lead the charge,and I&#39;ll destroy all the Servants I can get my hands on.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> After all, they&#39;ve got that woman.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Scáthach?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, she IS my mentor. I can&#39;t imagine any other man being able to handle her.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –Do you want to fight her?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> No. I am a king. A king doesn&#39;t fight for self-interest.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I am the frame in establishing this nation. I&#39;ll devote myself to being a weapon slaughtering opponents.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> As long as Karna lives, Arjuna won&#39;t have the composure to deal with other Servants.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If that is the case, I&#39;ll go. I&#39;ll go, and I&#39;ll kill.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Very well. I won&#39;t stop you. Ride forth, my king!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hahaha, hahaha, hahahahaha! The least kingly king in the world.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Despite having no intention of unifying the nation,you devote yourself to its creation.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you never lose. You always kill the opposition. Once all opposition is gone, you may even turn on your allies.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Perhaps that&#39;s the very thing I&#39;ve been desiring most.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> For a king such as you to throw everything in this world into chaos.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> To wipe out everyone equally, with your Gáe Bolg.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh believers of justice and miracles...Hurry up and come here! Let me lead you to your unsightly death!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...A message from Karna!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> We&#39;ve engaged the enemy vanguard.

Please stop them, Master.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take the right wing. Nightingale can handle the left.

Then let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> –All done!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Their vanguard is this big? They must&#39;ve figured out the South Army is the main force, and sent in their elites.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> It looks like it.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> The all-out clash is coming soon. Everybody, stay on guard!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Nothing less from the king of Kosala.

Good grief, this is like a scene from a nightmare.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Arjuna...The legendary hero. The Mahabharata is practically all about him.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> He grasps victory in every battlefield.

Somehow, having your guarantee makes my hair stand on end!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hahaha. Brilliant. Like the dawn of a new year!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Heh. A good Master and good Servants. It&#39;s no wonder we&#39;ve made it this far.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Thanks to that, I have no doubts either.

Shall we begin where we left off?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> ...We shall, Arjuna.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Both you and I seem to be held captive by a chronic disease that can never be cured.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...However.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Yes.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> –That is our very delight.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> This world has no gods, no curses, not even destiny.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Precisely because there aren&#39;t, I made facing you my only desire upon the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...And now, that wish has come true. I have no interest in saving this world.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> If it is to perish, it shall perish. Yet, you attempt to save it–this world.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Of course. As long as people wishing to live proper lives exist, I will continue to protect them.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> I was given this power for that purpose. Know that as long as my father and my life remain, the sun remains immortal.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> That is why I am for destruction.

Do you know the saying“Curses, like chickens, come home to roost”?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ?</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> No, it&#39;s nothing. There was once someone who taught me that. Watching you just reminded me of him.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Like it or not, we&#39;ve known each other the longest. On account of that, promise me one thing.</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> If you defeat me, fulfill your original duty as a Heroic Spirit.

A completely different guy.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mash, calm down.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Mash, he&#39;s an enemy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes, I know.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Wait, Cú Chulainn! What happened to Scáthach–</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Hm? Oh, I defeated Scáthach.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...You don&#39;t mince your words, do you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No, not Scáthach...Impossible...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Oh yeah, no need for condolences.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You&#39;re all going to die here, too. Go lick each other&#39;s wounds on the other side.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> He&#39;s coming! Don&#39;t hold back on Command Spells, we&#39;ll fight with all we&#39;ve got!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Hah...Hah...Hah...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> The strength of that shield...Strange. I don&#39;t recall a shield so powerful, not even in folklore.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But it&#39;s definitely a Noble Phantasm. Girl, that shield—</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Never mind. It won&#39;t matter if I take you down, anyway!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Noble Phantasm incoming, Mash! That vermilion spear aims for your heart no matter what!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You have to run at full speed!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s no use, I won&#39;t make it!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s go time–My demonic thorn of death.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What...</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Dozing off as I stroll along,I find myself in a strange land of wilderness.</p><p><strong>H：???:</strong><br> Is this the dream continued, or merely an illusion? Well, not that it matters.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Good morning and hello, all. Everyone&#39;s trusted advisor, Mr. Merlin, is here.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mer...Who?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Who&#39;s that cocky fellow!?</p><hr><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Right, you, never mind that. This appearance is a special service, an incognito visit totally on a whim.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Your paths and mine are not yet set to cross. I mean, I should be a shut-in from a tower in paradise to begin with.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Just consider this a lucky visit from a wonderful gentleman and be done with it, okay?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> So–what kind of blockhead are you? Is this what they call a daydream?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Of course. It&#39;s my ol&#39; specialty,making do by confusing the opponent!</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Oh! Congratulations on your coronation, Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> To think the day would come when the great hero of Ireland settles down on a throne. My, my, destiny is a strange thing.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> This feeling...You must be an incubus...Which means...I see, you are the Stargazer.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Your meddling is breaking the rules. Is this fine, mage? Your pride will crumble to pieces.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Not to worry, we&#39;ll play it by ear. Besides, I have no pride or principles, or anything like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Who–are you–?</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> I watch everything in this world from an island in the farthest lands. Yes, I watch everything.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> That&#39;s the important point. I am but an observer, simply observing...At least for now.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> ...Whoa, I really am about to wake from my nap.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Sorry, but this is about all the help I can lend you. You&#39;ll have to finish slaying that beast on your own.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Once you have done so,the future in which we meet shall come.</p><p><strong>Merlin:</strong><br> Farewell, then, until that slightly altered future. Take care of Cath Palug for me.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Tch, behind me!</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> Burn him to ashes...“Vasavi Shakti! ”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Tch!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Karna!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Karna:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t strong enough...to reach him...Master...farewell...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Karna...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> One last struggle at the very end. This is why I never trust the comings and goings of spearman.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Quit babbling, now&#39;s the chance–!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Right back at you, scumbag! Flaunting your borrowed feathers...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That attack left me scorched all over. I&#39;ll be going home to cool off now.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s no use fleeing, Cú Chulainn. No matter how great your fury, that wound will never heal.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You are ill.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Ha. It&#39;s as you say, bloody saint. The day I&#39;m healed will probably never come.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll simply continue being king,until the day I fall and rot.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Come and get me, if you can. I&#39;ll fight you in Washington.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Don&#39;t let this opportunity pass! All forces push, push, push!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I am sorry Arjuna, but I must kill you!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Er, Nightingale!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Arjuna. Have you any desire of receiving treatment?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Treatment? What illness do you think I have?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Karna tried to be a Servant. That is all.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Despite trying to be a hero with a second life, you do not wish to be a Servant.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Our existence sides with neither. We have our self-interests, yet we also have a given Order.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In that moment, Karna acted as a Servant, and believed that stopping Cú Chulainn would lead to victory.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...He believed that it was the right thing to do than indulging you with your deep-rooted obsession.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Obsession? My long-standing desire...</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> How could the likes of you ever understand!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> H-Hey, Nightingale. Er, maybe you shouldn&#39;t provoke him too much!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –It&#39;s a mistaken obsession. No use crying over spilt milk. Defeating a nemesis with an arrow you shouldn&#39;t have shot–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You must live the rest of your life with that regret. That&#39;s how it is for other heroes, too.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Madly wishing to redo, seeking a wish never granted.... Despite that, a Servant doesn&#39;t cross that final line.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You did not try to understand that final line.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...I...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Will you fight? If you would like to, you may.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re right. There&#39;s no need to fight. I don&#39;t even want to vent my anger.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> But I...want to settle the score. In order to purge this unmanageable something in my heart.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;ll understand if you decline.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Let&#39;s fight.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> H-Hey!? Master, you&#39;re going to fight Arjuna!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Who is!? We are, yup, of course!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> We&#39;ll win.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hahahahaha, Master! I&#39;ve got something to say to you, as a fellow warrior!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> There&#39;s no telling whether we&#39;ll win. After all, our opponent is Arjuna!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ah, what the heck! Let&#39;s do this!</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> –Thank you. Then let us battle, if you please.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> My name is Arjuna. Consider it an honor–to fall by my arrow!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I also have the pride of having bested the Demon King Ravana. –Prepare yourself, Arjuna!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> How&#39;s that, Arjuna!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Do you feel better now?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Yes, very much. I appreciate you putting up with my self-indulgence.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Arjuna. Well...If you wouldn&#39;t mind, could you lend us a hand?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Unfortunately, I cannot. Though I strongly desire to.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sure to make amends for what I&#39;ve done. Will you please believe me?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I will.</p><hr><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> ...Your words ring true, even in my hollowed heart. Farewell, then.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Arjuna...What did he...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It means he was able to sort out his feelings.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> He is not as faithful as others think,nor as evil as he himself believes.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> He must&#39;ve led quite a stifling life when he was alive.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> After all, he&#39;d been living a life that was decided for him by someone else.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Oh, I see. Arjuna must have wanted a fresh start.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That day, that moment, that arrow he shot at Karna...He&#39;d been regretting it all his life.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> His illness has been cured. Though the price he paid...was all too great.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But despite that, we must forge ahead.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Nightingale is right. All right, march on! Let&#39;s charge all the way to Washington!</p><h2 id="section-20-north-american-myth-war-middle" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-20-north-american-myth-war-middle" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 20: North American Myth War (Middle)</h2><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Forward! The northern front has already clashed with the main army! There&#39;s no telling how long they&#39;ll last!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Speed! Speed will determine the winner!

All troops, charge!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> No stopping, not even for a moment! We&#39;ll come down on them in one giant blow!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s the matter?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m sorry. I was thinking of Scáthach.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Scáthach said she could never defeat Cú Chulainn, but I didn&#39;t believe her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I felt nobody could ever defeat Scáthach. So—there was a part of me that wasn&#39;t worried.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A part of me that thought, even if we failed here, Scáthach would set it right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, it didn&#39;t turn out that way.... Scáthach was right.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But, I still don&#39;t understand. I don&#39;t understand how Scáthach could&#39;ve lost...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –“Gáe Bolg! ”</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> “Gáe Bolg Alternative–! ”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Ugh!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> A clash of Gáe Bolgs, unimaginable during our lifetimes.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Both claim to deliver fatal blows,while at the same time evading them.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> With different Noble Phantasms, this would&#39;ve ended in death, not a draw. But both our Noble Phantasms are forbidden magical spears.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Both thorns of death trace identical paths and clash. A curious phenomenon– one that may never occur again.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...But my, that right arm of yours. Have you been repairing it with rune spells as you throw your spear?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Pretty much.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You&#39;re not waiting until the destruction ends to begin regenerating, unlike me.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You&#39;re regenerating while it is being destroyed. The pain must be excruciating...No, I am sure “excruciating” is not even enough to describe it.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Pain can be managed. I&#39;m already prepared for the worst.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Hmph, you&#39;ve been enduring it well too, my mentor.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Not really.... In the end, I&#39;m merely buying time.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> In the past—I&#39;ve even dreamed of being killed by you.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> “I should&#39;ve died before things became this way,” I thought. If I regret anything about my life, that would be it.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –But, I have no desire to be killed by your current self. Personally, I preferred your previous self.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not obligated to shoulder any of the burden you bear. My path is simple and straightforward.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I can&#39;t afford to be taking detours,nor can I afford to carry someone else&#39;s baggage.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;ll take the shortest path to be king, and to rule.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –For whom? Is it for Medb?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Medb wished upon the Holy Grail, and made you into a king. But that was never your wish.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What makes you think so? Do you really think I&#39;ve never dreamed of becoming king?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> You never mentioned such a dream when you were alive.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> True. Just as you say–in life,the thought of becoming king never crossed my mind.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> However. Isn&#39;t it common for Servants to harbor new dreams that might not have existed when they were alive?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...So, it&#39;s the opposite. You&#39;re trying to become a king as a result of becoming king.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –What a foolish contradiction. Despite becoming king, nothing indicated you became one.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That&#39;s why you have to destroy everything.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> If a man stands alone in the deserted wilderness,then indeed, he must be the unopposed king.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s fine by me. That solution feels best. A hero&#39;s existence is full of contradictions, after all.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> It&#39;s not for Medb. I brandish this spear for my own self-interest.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Now, you must be running out of ways to stall for time. Let&#39;s put an end to this, Scáthach.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> —Such an idiot. You&#39;re an idiot down to your bones, yet you&#39;re thinking so hard.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> But no matter. I&#39;m finished with my questions. Gates, open.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Tch!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> “Gate of Skye. ”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm that transports people to the Land of Shadows!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m taking you with me.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> My mentor...You must&#39;ve sensed it. That you can&#39;t defeat me.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You know you can&#39;t win, even using that Noble Phantasm, yes? –That&#39;s correct.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> A Noble Phantasm that transports, yet doesn&#39;t kill—Your consideration for others this late in the game is why you will lose.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Noble Phantasm seal. Transform–!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Wh-What?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –You stopped moving, Scáthach!</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Gah!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> “Curruid Coinchenn”–This is one trick I didn&#39;t learn from you.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> This Noble Phantasm is the one and only thing that can punch a hole in that gut of yours.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...So you&#39;ve reached that far, huh? That&#39;s enough power to destroy the world.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I bet it is. As things stand, I&#39;ll be doing just that.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –Cú Chulainn. That&#39;s what I don&#39;t understand.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Living and fighting. Those used to be your greatest joys.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Those were the big prerequisites. That is why you lived so beautifully.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Yet why do you insist on being so ugly?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m ugly, yes. Because as far as I&#39;ve seen, that&#39;s what a king is.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...What......Who knew you were such an honest idiot?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Goodbye, Scáthach. We&#39;ll probably never meet again.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Too bad. As a fellow spearman,I would&#39;ve liked to try fighting him, but–</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> I had to prioritize a previous appointment. You alive?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Somehow. Jumping through the gates myself to fling my body to the outsides of the world must&#39;ve worked.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> I&#39;ve patched up my outward appearance, but that&#39;s about it. To put it into perspective, 90% of my organs are destroyed.</p><p><strong>C：???:</strong><br> Hm, that&#39;s a problem. You can&#39;t fight like that.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> If we were to fight, it&#39;d be when this era ends. Until then, Shuwen, would you help those guys out?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Which side?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...The North Army. The South Army has Fujimaru, but the North Army doesn&#39;t. This is a big difference.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> All right. Then I&#39;ll head to the North Army. You stay here, until the era comes to an end.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sure to come back for you. Whether the era ends, or the world ends. I promise.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> After all, that divine spear has reached a realm beyond human understanding. If you disappear before I fight it, I&#39;ll surely go mad.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Suit yourself. How can I refuse so earnest a request?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Fine. I look forward to your return. If you don&#39;t mind a cowardly spear that lost to its disciple.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Kaka! I wouldn&#39;t count that as a loss. Your objective was different from the start.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Realize the competition of spears has just begun, mistress. Time to see if my divine spear will stand up to a true god.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...Well, I suppose I should save the world first, though. Too bad. All I want to do is fight strong opponents...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...but the world is such a hard place to live in.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> That is the fate of us Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hahahahaha—that&#39;s for sure.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Here they come again.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Wait a second, how many of them are there? They just keep coming!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Did you really clean up 60% of them?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Well yeah, of course. I take my work seriously. It&#39;s one of my few redeeming qualities.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Poisoning their food and water, burning, drowning, dropping rocks...Even some treachery amongst them.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I used all sorts of tricks to cut out 60% of them. But there&#39;s still many left. Don&#39;t you just hate it?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Seriously, what is it with those guys?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Normally when you lose 60% of your troops,morale plummets and retreat is par for the course.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I suppose there is one exception, though...</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> The case of ridiculously strong leaders being ridiculously tyrannical.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Encore after encore no matter how much I sing...I feel lucky as an idol, but I&#39;m not happy about this!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s just our job this time around.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> How are they doing over there?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Karna was killed in battle.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I see. That guy was crazy strong, too.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell Old Man Edison. He&#39;ll probably sink into depression.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I figured as much. Is the [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] doing all right?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, they defeated Cú Chulainn, who then retreated. They&#39;re marching toward Washington with Rama and the others.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Our tasks remain the same?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Not sure about that. Hey! Old Man Edison!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Should we keep going!?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Of course, sounds good!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Looks like it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ah, too bad. It&#39;s tiresome, but I guess we can give it one more push.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Direct current is the best! Am I right!?</p><p><strong>Mechanized Infantry:</strong><br> Of course, Mr. Presi-king! All hail direct current! Brilliant domination!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Yes, yes, direct current is the best, the best. And now...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> —Behold, the Book of Dzyan in my hand. Light, shine here. Hierarchy in the heavens, Lemuria in the sea.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> And on earth, myself! Old things and new, make everything clear!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Everything seems to be going smoothly...But life never goes so well, does it?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Hm. Yes, it&#39;ll be here soon, without a doubt.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh, what&#39;ll be here? ...Wh-What the...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> –Life never goes so well, does it?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Wait, is this it? A cunning Archer and a scrawny Lancer?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Where are the people who defeated me?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> They&#39;re out. And it&#39;s “slender,” not scrawny!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey, was that a compliment?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Yes, it&#39;s a compliment. Cutting us by 60%, just by laying traps.... But with 40% left, victory is ours.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...Ugh, I can&#39;t stand it.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Crude, insensitive, and shameless. On top of that, muscles, tattoos, and stubble!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Nothing could be more vulgar! That settles it! You take him.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;d like to say “Yeah, sure”–But I&#39;m afraid I may die without your help.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> What a slacker.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> My only talents are long-range combat, killing with poison, and sabotage.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Then go stand behind me and shoot your little arrows.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Bring it on, half-naked man. Having one dragon slayer is more than enough!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d at least call me by my True Name, scr...slender Lancer!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Can you go assist Elisabeth and Robin Hood!?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s impossible. It&#39;s taking all I can to hold back the Celts! You little...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Alas, when it comes to tenacity, we just can&#39;t match these Celtic soldiers...How disappointing.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So these are the limits of mass production...No, not true! It&#39;s just that my approach was incorrect!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I can&#39;t lose. I must grasp the glory of success someday! As the one responsible, I must make an effort!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hmph!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Bastard!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> –Ha!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Sorry. Despite being a Berserker, I&#39;m not really insane.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> If anything, I&#39;m just a little more ferocious. I don&#39;t easily lose the techniques I&#39;ve cultivated.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Damn it, I hate these types...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Eli-Eli and Robin are in trouble. Not good!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> –Then allow me.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Huh!?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Whoa.... Hey now, who are you?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Just a passing divine spear. My True Name is Li Shuwen.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I suppose it&#39;s a perk for this job. To be able to fight the famous Beowulf. The highest honor.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Oh? Not one for modesty with a name like “Divine Spear. ” Li Shuwen...Yes, I&#39;ve heard a lot about you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Oh, it&#39;s just an old nickname. So, what shall we do?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Beowulf. You&#39;re the warrior known for killing the monster Grendel with your bare hands. In that case—</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Heh, you sure know how to flatter. And who were you, again?</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Ah, yes, yes. “No Second Strike,” right? Don&#39;t need a second strike! What a claim!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Hm. How about we put it to the test? We&#39;ll see if it&#39;s real or an exaggeration.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> What a coincidence, for two Servants who can fight unarmed to meet in this place.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Fate is such an odd thing.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> It sure is strange. Which means...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...a so-called fistfight?</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know whether these fists will work on you or not. But I think I&#39;d like to give it a try.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Let&#39;s see you withstand my Bajiquan!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> That&#39;s fine. Many winters have passed since my honoring as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Yet it&#39;s hard to forget that feeling...That moment when I beat that guy to death.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> And now, a guy who looks even stronger than Grendel is standing before me.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> So–no one would turn down such an opportunity!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Indeed!</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> One.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Two...</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Three!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Whoa! A f-fistfight! Is it a fistfight!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> This is so scary! Stop them, Greenie!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> No thanks! Even God couldn&#39;t stop a fight like this!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Wow, man, it&#39;s hard to believe we&#39;re the same species.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> What&#39;s with that? Sometimes I don&#39;t get how men think at all.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oh, come on. Girls box too, don&#39;t they? All warriors dream of a fistfight. It&#39;s their instinct.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Although, being an inventor,I wouldn&#39;t know much about it.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Whatever.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Either way, the only Servant who could ever stand up to Beowulf in a fistfight is him.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Let&#39;s leave Beowulf to Li Shuwen. We should focus on doing what we can.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. But Edison, I...have a bad feeling about this.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Your bad feelings are always on the mark. Whatever is to come, let us be prepared.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> All right! Mostly done–What!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Medb&#39;s elite soldiers...Shadow Servants! Master, we should handle this! Your orders, please!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...All Shadow Servants have been eliminated!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re almost at the capital, Washington. Cú Chulainn and Queen Medb should be there.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Karna and Scáthach are no longer with us. However, we do have our Master...Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> If we concentrate our power, we can defeat them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Are you forcing yourself?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Gah. No, uh...Well, how can I say this...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...To be honest, I don&#39;t know if we can win. The difference in power is overwhelming.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yet I feel as though we can. I had the same feeling when I faced the Demon King Ravana.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You don&#39;t have to force yourself.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hah, I know. I&#39;m not forcing myself.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I&#39;m still far from my limit–Even if I reach it, I feel as though I can go further.</p><hr><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Hey, Master.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I feel love for you. Mash and Nightingale, too.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I love these soldiers, who follow my orders despite my young appearance.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> And I love Sita from the bottom of my heart,as she entrusted me with her life.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Love makes me want to protect,and love makes me not submit to fear.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Isn&#39;t it simple?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> However, when you think about it–a hero begins his journey from tiny feelings of that sort.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This is something I came to understand,after returning to my youth.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> –Now, let&#39;s go!</p><h2 id="section-21-north-american-myth-war-ending" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#section-21-north-american-myth-war-ending" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Section 21: North American Myth War (Ending)</h2><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> They&#39;ll be here soon, my king. How&#39;s your body?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> The restoration is complete. It&#39;d be a bit troublesome if Arjuna betrayed us, though–</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> If the need arises, we could always use “that. ”</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s not necessary. I am enough.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Throw everything at the northern front. That&#39;ll end the war, and this world.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –Right. Oh dear, I guess this is the end of playing queen.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Having fun?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, very much so. That&#39;s why I intend to enjoy it to the very end.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You aren&#39;t having fun, are you, Cú?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. You can have fun on your own.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> All I need to do is continue being the king you wished for. No matter what happens.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Yeah. I love you, Cú.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Is that so?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Now, let&#39;s begin the final battle.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> They&#39;ll struggle, and writhe, and try to stand up. All those who glare at us with determination in their eyes.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> We&#39;ll crush them under our heels easily. –Ahh, I&#39;m so excited!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> We&#39;re here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes! Master, we&#39;re just one step away!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The northern front is fighting well. At this rate, we should somehow–</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –So you&#39;ve come.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Oh dear, I guess those Shadow Servants really weren&#39;t good enough.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> You&#39;re–</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Medb. The queen who brings Celtic heroes into this world.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So you&#39;re...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Your scrap soldiers, or my cute boys–I wonder which are stronger?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Sorry, but we don&#39;t have time for idle chit chat. We&#39;ll be taking you down now.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;ve already calculated it. Your power, my power,my summoned warriors&#39; power, my monsters&#39; power...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ll make sure to win. After all, the one that the king trusted with everything was me, the queen!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> I&#39;ve confirmed enemy signatures. Analyzing the magical energy wavelengths—this is...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A massive dragonkin! Also–Chimeras,and even Shadow Servants!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sheesh, she&#39;s really going all out!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. We won&#39;t lose to enemies like that after all we&#39;ve been through!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master, let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I guess that wasn&#39;t enough to stop you.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...But I can&#39;t afford to lose. Come, Spriggan!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Even more of them!? Can Queen Medb really create an infinite number of soldiers!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I would hesitate to call it infinite.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It may be infinite given enough time, but we&#39;re defeating them faster than they&#39;re being created.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You could say that we&#39;re cornering her, both in Magecraft and science.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> However–</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> –H-Haha. Hahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Cornered? ME? Opposite. It&#39;s the opposite.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m the one cornering you. Come visit the White House.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Tch...She&#39;s staying out of range. So she knows that “Brahmastra” is a throwing weapon.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Let&#39;s go, everyone...Although we may not make it in time.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Make it in time?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> For what?</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...I don&#39;t know, but it seems like they&#39;re hiding a secret weapon.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Her smile wasn&#39;t because this is too easy for her,nor was it an attempt to mock us.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That was the smile of a predator.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> It was an unbearably sadistic smile, made right when she destroys something dear to us.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But it&#39;s not towards us. If it was, she would have used the trump card immediately.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In that case–</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Yes, I understand what you&#39;re trying to say, Nightingale. However, we must still pursue her.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Now, we head to the White House!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Ugh!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> –This is “Stalking Tiger,” a Bajiquan technique. Kung Fu that&#39;s been refined through thousands of years.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Like how mere fistfighting evolved into boxing,we developed fights to the death into techniques.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...This nation is the same. It&#39;s not something you should stick your hands into.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Heh...Seriously...Dammit, hitting that big Grendel was a lot easier.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Parrying incoming attacks is part of the technique. Try learning some boxing skills before your next summon.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...Hah...Sorry, but I refuse.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Thinking in the middle of a fistfight is like trying to wake yourself from a dream. Isn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Okay! That should do it...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Mr. Edison...You should hurry and send the troops back.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hm?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Just have them retreat! Hurry!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What, retreat?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Hey, we&#39;re winning. What&#39;s this all of a sudden?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Who knows. You&#39;d probably have to ask Edison to find–</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Wh-What!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aughhhhhhh!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> C-Calm down! It&#39;s just an earthquake, settle down!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> No, this is no mere earthquake! Augh!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Blavatsky?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Master. The White House...It&#39;s transformed...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Wh-What the hell is this!? Are you telling me that this is truly the White House!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Hm. Such extremely poor taste. The original White House was far more beautiful.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –Hey.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> ...Cú Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Queen Medb!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Hey, Demi-Servant. Don&#39;t utter my name so casually.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m in a bad mood, mind if I kill you?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Leave this place. Your wickedness is no illness. You were born with it.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;d say you&#39;re in good health. Although you&#39;re still wicked.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Stand back, Medb. She&#39;s got business with me.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> What are you going to do to Cú?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That goes without saying. I&#39;m a nurse. A nurse must fulfill her duty.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Huh? With Cú? As a nurse?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> In other words, I intend to treat him.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...What a simplistic reason. However, as my enemy, I intend to kill you.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> An enemy is an enemy, even if they&#39;re a nurse. It&#39;s simple.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Feel free to do as you please. I&#39;ll treat you, and you&#39;ll kill me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> While contradictory, that&#39;s how we should be. One thing to say before combat.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You are ill. I recommend suicide, or allowing yourself to be defeated.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;m not really one to talk, but you&#39;re pretty crazy, aren&#39;t you? What you&#39;re saying is pretty ridiculous.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –You can&#39;t feel joy.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Say that again?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, that&#39;s not quite right. It&#39;s not that you can&#39;t, it&#39;s that you don&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Becoming king didn&#39;t stop you from feeling joy. It only sealed your joy away.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Shut your mouth, nurse.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You&#39;ve trapped yourself in a cage, ceding your body to a “system” called a “king. ”</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Since you feel no joy, you fight automatically and mechanically. If you don&#39;t do so, you can&#39;t continue being king.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Didn&#39;t I tell you to shut up!?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You talk like you&#39;ve seen it for yourself. Did we have some sort of connection in our past life?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, I haven&#39;t seen it myself. I simply know, because that&#39;s how I used to be.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I cast aside my own humanity,working only to fulfill my goal.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I had to pay a price for that,but I didn&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I was fine being nothing more than a healing machine.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Of course, I can&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a twisted way of life. Nothing changed from when I was alive, working tenaciously at patient&#39;s bedside.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But still, I didn&#39;t mind. I simply wanted to help expand to the world, with an iron body and an iron will.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The hope for medical treatment. The delight of recovery. These things were needed in the world at the time.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> For that, I abandoned everything I had, but I have no regrets!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –So let me ask, king of savages. Is your rule truly necessary?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> What prospects for the future do you have? Where do you aim to be, after all is done?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Who knows.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You have nothing. Your deeds are like severe burns. That&#39;s why–you and I are different.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My blood boils, for the sake of dreams. Your blood has grown thick and cold, for the sake of ambition.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is your illness. Allow me to treat you, Cú Chulainn.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Even if I die, I must treat you.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...You done talking? Your lecture was so crazy that I actually couldn&#39;t help but listen.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Ill. Ill. Illness, huh? I see, I get it. Pretty fitting. I was used to things like curses and wounds, but—</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I&#39;d never actually suffered from illness before. This what you&#39;d call “seeing the light,” iron woman.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> That must mean this overbearing sense of fatigue is an illness.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> If this body is healed, and this blood is purified, I might return to my senses.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –But that&#39;s not possible. I think you&#39;re well aware of that.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You know, in this world there are incurable diseases that you can never recover from, right?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Well then. Here I go!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Let&#39;s go, Cú!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m Medb, queen of Connacht. I won&#39;t lose to people like you!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I am Rama, king of Kosala. This task was handed down to me, by those who have fallen.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> So long as you threaten to destroy this world–my fighting spirit, my will shall never falter.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> In the name of my wife Sita,I swear by the name of the god I hold faith in.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I shall smite thee as an iron hammer. Prepare yourself, Queen Medb!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> –Right there! “Brahmastra! ”</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...We did it...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Uh–Ugh–</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Tch. You&#39;re in pretty bad shape, Medb.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, Cú. I feel like I could die at any moment. But I fulfilled my role...</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I really, really did it.... Will you praise me?</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> —Yeah. You did pretty well.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> You defended your nation, as queen. You&#39;re a pretty capable woman, when you try.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m glad. That&#39;s all I wanted to hear.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> That was enough to save me. My wish came true.</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> You&#39;ve finally–become mine.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s this “role? ”</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What did you do?</p><hr><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Ahahahaha! Ahahahaha! Don&#39;t you know my name?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> I&#39;m Medb! Queen Medb! Don&#39;t you know of my greatest work, from my legend?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> The “Clan Calatin! ” A group of warriors to defeat the peerless hero, Cú Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> So that&#39;s your trump card? Very well then, summon them!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> ...Ahaha...That&#39;s wrong, so wrong. It&#39;s completely different from what you imagine!</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Completely, and totally wrong!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...Wait. Is that possible? Should it even be possible!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> A Heroic Spirit can&#39;t possibly come up with something that terrifying! I mean, is it even possible through Magecraft!?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Queen Medb! This is something not even Solomon dared try!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor!? Doctor, what exactly is happening!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing strange here—</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> The North Army!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> That&#39;s right! THAT was summoned on them just now!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t tell me that&#39;s...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A Demon God Pillar?</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> ...I&#39;ve confirmed 28 Demon God Pillars at the northern front!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...What?</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> To summon an entire pack of Demon God Pillars by shoving them into the framework of “Clan Calatin! ”</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s theoretically possible for a wielder of the Holy Grail. It&#39;s definitely possible...But a total of 28 of them!?</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Is that really possible!?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Her wish must have been that powerful. More so than any other to date.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –If it was for that man. She would offer any sacrifice. Even her own life.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Doctor, the Servants on the northern front!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...What is this!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s, you know...A major boss.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Why would something like that appear here!? Is our [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] okay!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...We&#39;ve received a transmission. It seems they&#39;re fine.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> In other words, the enemy sent these here to crush us instead!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...There&#39;s no way to win. It&#39;s a whole group of Demon God Pillars.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> They aren&#39;t something that mere Servants can handle. However, escaping is impossible, too.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Well, this just means we&#39;ve got to give up. Li Shuwen, they&#39;d be too much even for you.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...As I&#39;d expect.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...This is the end.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Edison?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> There&#39;s no way to win against this! Look, just look!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> There&#39;s 28 of them!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Even a single one would require multiple Servants to defeat!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Edison! Calm yourself! You mustn&#39;t panic!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> It seems...Justice is defeated...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ......Hey, lion head.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Lion head? Lion...There&#39;s no lion here...Oh, you must mean me! Wh-What is it, horned lady?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Well you see—Quit your whining!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Aah, my ear!?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> It&#39;s true that we&#39;re in a pinch, in trouble, in a catastrophe! But that [♂ Puppy /♀ Deerlet] trusted us to do this!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> If we can hold out here, we win! If we give up now, the front will collapse, right!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> That&#39;s right, but these things are on a different level. Would our attacks even be effective?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Even if they aren&#39;t effective, it&#39;s fine if we just survive! I don&#39;t care what anyone says, I won&#39;t lose!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> No, I can&#39;t stand losing to them! They killed my rival...They killed my friend Nero!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Sure, that&#39;s fine, but...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Hey you– Get out of the way!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Aaaaah!?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Above you! You&#39;ve got to look above you! And wipe those tears.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> ...I-I know that! Let&#39;s pull ourselves together and fight, Greenie!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> I&#39;ve got a name, learn it already! ...So, Old Man Edison?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> What will you do? You can try to run, if you want.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> We can still buy time, if you go now.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Now, bring it on! Clan Calatin!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> I, Elisabeth Báthory–will send you to your death with my hit song!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...You leaving now?</p><p><strong>Medb:</strong><br> Yes, I am.

Are you–</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> –I&#39;ve always been one to take the long road. I never had much luck with good women. It never lasted.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> But all the bad women flock to me. Medb was especially tenacious, more so than briar vines...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Sheesh. The moment she becomes good, she disappears looking satisfied.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> He seems a little different?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...He&#39;s more like when we met in Fuyuki...</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Just slightly, but the magical energy surrounding him has weakened.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The era&#39;s ability to correct itself probably strengthened, because the one who wished Cú Chulainn into kingship vanished.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> It&#39;s basically like a 0% chance became 3%...But now there&#39;s a possibility!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Listen, you have to defeat Cú Chulainn, before the northern front collapses!

It is difficult.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But one is a hero because one treads past countless despair.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> If I keep forcing such burdens upon such a little lady...I&#39;d be a disgrace to America!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hahahaha!

And you say that you of all people, intend to help me!?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> You must be joking! Even if I was summoned a thousand times, I would never help you!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I intend to save this era–And those whom I owe a debt to.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I caused them a bit of trouble in England, after all.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> That relic from the Age of Gods is destined to disappear, due to the power of electricity I paved the path to.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Edison. Just stand aside and witness the beauty of my grand lightning!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Mmph, that laugh sounds like he&#39;s been practicing it every morning in front of a mirror! Such meticulous planning, fit for a genius!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> But don&#39;t mess with me, Tesla! In the end, you&#39;re nothing more than an eccentric that stood out!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A true genius is universal! You&#39;re not one to talk! You couldn&#39;t even find a wife! You stayed single your whole life!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> –Fool. That just means no woman was able to match me. Genius begets a solitary life. You really are an ordinary man.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;m not ordinary! I&#39;m a CEO! I&#39;m tired of seeing geniuses! People like Bell!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> A CEO must use geniuses well! You don&#39;t even understand that!? Fool! You fool!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Hey. Old Man Edison. Isn&#39;t he being really childish right now!?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> –Yes, yes. Okay, geniuses. It&#39;s about time to start dealing with reality.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Even the power of electricity can&#39;t defeat these monsters.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...Hmph. I wasn&#39;t summoned by that strange man to defeat those things.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> That Master is the one fighting, correct? Then, I simply have to keep these monsters sealed away.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...An electrical cage.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Hah. I suppose even an ordinary man would realize it if I gave away these many hints.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Now, out of the way! “System Keraunos! ”</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Feel the power of the thunder and lightning of a new legend!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> What!? Maybe I held back too much!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –Hah!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> You always choke at the very end. That&#39;s why people never write decent biographies about you.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> By the way, my biography is distributed globally.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Why you!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This is true electricity, true thunder!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Tch.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Fine, we must work together. Of course, since I have the higher power output. Sync with me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That much I agree with. All right then. I&#39;ll overload it a bit and continuously hit those eerie monsters–</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Yes. We&#39;ll hit them with enough lightning to keep killing an immortal monster until the end of time.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...Here goes!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –Got it. Noble Phantasm–activate!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Thunder and lighting, descend!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Bring light to this world that has plunged into darkness!</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> –“World Faith Domination! ”–“System Keraunos! ”</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> So, what do we do now?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I just told you! Our only duty is to keep those things sealed away!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I hate to admit it, but even among ancient relics that should vanish one day, some items have their uses.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> That&#39;s...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> I&#39;m observing an enormous amount of Ether!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What!? What exactly is happening–</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> –Expanding sacred domain. Domain secured. Setting divine punishment enforcement limits. Calculating amount of time needed for magical energy convergence and acceleration.</p><p><strong>E：???:</strong><br> –Countdown.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> It&#39;s Arjuna!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Please evacuate at once, if you could. I&#39;ll try to keep the range as small as possible, but–</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I will sacrifice myself with this attack, after all. I won&#39;t be holding back.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...A weapon...From the Age of Gods...A Divine Construct?</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> G-Get away! We&#39;ll be consumed by it too!</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> By the rage of Shiva, your life ends here. “Pashupata”– Take this!</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...You&#39;re kidding...He did it?</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> I hope this is–enough to atone for my actions.</p><p><strong>Arjuna:</strong><br> Karna...How you felt...Now I...finally...</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We won...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It would seem so...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> We really did it, Robin!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Although I&#39;ve got mixed feelings, as a fellow Archer. Man, it&#39;s a big world out there.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...Now that I&#39;ve finished my duty here,I must hurry and attend to my other business.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Pardon me.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Hahaha!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> His Noble Phantasm may have dealt the finishing blow, but it was MY electrical skills that contained those giants!</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Cease your delusions, Edison. You were simply backup. Mere support.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> It was Nikola Tesla&#39;s electricity that sealed those monsters. If I had full power, I could&#39;ve blown up the whole continent!</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...Hmm, I could argue about that if I wanted to, but...I&#39;m in an extremely good mood right now.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I&#39;ll just leave it at that. Period, times infinity.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...What? Do you want to fight?</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> –Of course not. I wouldn&#39;t lend an ear to the jokes of an ordinary man–</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Oops, my hand slipped.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Oops, my electricity slipped.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Um, they&#39;ve started fighting.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Just leave them. The war&#39;s over. They&#39;re free to hurt each other however they want.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...Even the articles of William Hearst wouldn&#39;t contain such absurd spectacles.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> –Heh, but those two are both heading down the proper path...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That path just happens to be narrow,so they always end up fighting each other.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> In the past, those who wished to see happiness for others were forced to take up the sword.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> If they didn&#39;t rule through violence, no one would know happiness.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...But those two were different. They fought not with swords, but with their intellect.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> In other words, they&#39;re proof that humanity slowly progressed–the fruit of history itself.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Do you understand that, Beowulf? Your side never had a chance of victory from the very start.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> They&#39;ve brought happiness and fortune to far more people...than your side ever could.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...So it&#39;s not an era of strength anymore, huh? How sad.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Perhaps so. To move forward and make progress, something must be lost.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Brilliant tales of heroes vanish,and what&#39;s left is mostly bland and uninteresting–</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> But these scholars and eccentrics share the same passion of “making a nameless someone happy” and work their hardest to achieve that.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> ...I see. But for now, you still need some strength like mine, right?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. Farewell, Beowulf.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Hope you&#39;re summoned by Fujimaru next time.</p><p><strong>Beowulf:</strong><br> Hahahahaha! Sounds great, that may give me more fun than I had this time!</p><p><strong>--ARROW--</strong></p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Y-You, you did it–! Everyone, we won!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> The “Clan Calatin” at the northern front has completely vanished!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> And Cú Chulainn&#39;s finished as well!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Confirmed Spirit Origin collapse! Heroic Spirit Cú Chulainn&#39;s materialization is fading!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This is the end, Cú Chulainn!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Tch. Geez, looks like I&#39;ve lost my touch...</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> ...Well. This is the end of the Mad King Cú Chulainn&#39;s role.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> However–before I&#39;m done, I&#39;ve got to summon the Demon God guarding the Holy Grail.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Good luck, brats.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> O Holy Grail. The ultimate vessel to make wishes come true.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Manifest. Remember. You have joined the 72 Demon Gods!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> There&#39;s still more!? Ugh, my Noble Phantasm&#39;s has just about run out.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Cú Chulainn...is far too powerful!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No way...We&#39;re already at the limit of our power! We can&#39;t keep fighting consecutive battles like this—</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I shall sever all that is poisonous,and all that is harmful–Nightingale Pledge!</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> My wounds!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –Master, now is the time to save lives. I shall treat your wounds. Everything will be as it was before.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Over, and over, as many times as it takes. To crush the outrageous, to overcome despair.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> For that, I offer everything I have.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> One of the 72 Demon God Pillars...Rank number 38. The Demon of War, Halphas.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> War will never vanish from this world. Weapons will never disappear from this world.</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> Mortals are fated to continue fighting,turning like screws in an endless cycle.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –No! No! I deny it! I shall shout it tens of thousands of times!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> When the lives saved outnumber those lost,the spiral of conflict should eventually cease turning!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No, I&#39;ll MAKE it cease. That is my task, as a Servant.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> So begone from this world, Demon God. I shall never give up, even if it means a thousand deaths!</p><p><strong>Cú Chulainn Alter:</strong><br> I am the one who bestows conflict. You who wish for peace in your hearts...You are unnecessary!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Holy Grail recovery...Mission complete! But...There were too many sacrifices...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> What are you saying? We&#39;re Servants. We were summoned to fight, and destined to fight for salvation.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> This battle was on an epochal scale.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Some might regret that they never finish the fight, but none of them run away from it.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> See them off with a smile.</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Sigh, I&#39;m tired! France, then Rome, and now America!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Sheesh, you should know when to stop calling for encores.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> You&#39;ve already been summoned three times!? Why? Is there some sort of demand for virgin girls?</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> W-Wh-Who are you calling a virgin!? If you say it again, I&#39;ll hit you with my mic, you pervert!</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. Still, I&#39;d say our Master&#39;s pretty good.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> This is the fifth one, right? How many hells have they ventured into...</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Yes, although they&#39;re still far from my ideal Master–</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> But I quite like their spirit,constantly reaching for the stars!</p><p><strong>Elisabeth:</strong><br> Anyway, Robin. I&#39;ll be going first.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> Yeah, take care. Sigh, I wonder if I&#39;ll be called again.</p><p><strong>Robin Hood:</strong><br> ...Maybe I should study up on effective traps,for every era and location.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Mr. Edison. The world was saved, isn&#39;t that wonderful?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> Yes...That&#39;s right, this was for the best.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> We are “e pluribus unum. ”Even America cannot stand alone.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> I gave in to despair, and thought only of this nation...That was my first blunder.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I think that&#39;s fine.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> In the end, it&#39;s because you fought back that you were able to keep this nation safe before they arrived.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> There might be countless mistakes during the process, but finding the correct answer from those is what Edison does best, right?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> –Hah. Just like an ordinary man of action.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> You encounter needless troubles because you rush blindly into challenges without understanding the theories.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> ...What, you mean empty theories? Like those of a certain someone.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> What?</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> You two could at least try to get along when it&#39;s time to depart...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s about time. Mr. Edison, I&#39;m glad I was able to fight alongside you.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> Mr. Tesla, I recognize you&#39;re a genius,but you should learn to fit in with others.</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> ...I say that, but I suppose you&#39;re a genius because you didn&#39;t learn to fit in...</p><p><strong>Blavatsky:</strong><br> It seems difficult to be a genius.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –Good grief. To think I&#39;d join forces with you of all people to save this nation.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> There are things unthinkable in our lifetimes. That&#39;s just what it means to be a Servant, Mr. Ordinary.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> –Hah. I will be summoned again, and this time–I will fight for [♂ his /♀ her] sake.</p><p><strong>Edison:</strong><br> This time as a proper Servant...along with Karna and Blavatsky.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> ...Hmph. This is as irritating as static electricity. To think my conclusions are the same as an ordinary man&#39;s.</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> Yes—but it&#39;s the truth. If opportunity arises, this thunder god shall fight for humanity. Though...</p><p><strong>Nikola Tesla:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have no issues if I&#39;m summoned first,but that is something that depends on luck...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Nightingale!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Yes?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> When I was about to fall to my knees,your voice helped me stand again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Thank you very much!</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There&#39;s no need to thank me. That&#39;s how our agreement was originally, anyway.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> –It seems the treatment is complete. We healed the injuries of an entire nation, not just an individual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah, thanks to you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Thank you.</p><hr><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> While gratitude is unnecessary, I&#39;ll accept it respectfully. However, in exchange...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please, allow me to shake your hand, [♂ Mr. /♀ Ms. ] Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My secret pleasure was to shake a patient&#39;s hand like this when they were discharged from hospital.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Of course, gladly.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll adjust my strength accordingly. Anyway, stay healthy, my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You have a rather cute side.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Cute isn&#39;t quite the right expression. Joy of this sort is just good etiquette as a nurse.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> ...Good grief. To think you&#39;re still well enough to make such a bad joke. It seems I&#39;ve underestimated you, Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Sorry to interrupt a good scene. With the Holy Grail&#39;s recovery, the era correction will begin soon!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Preparations for the Rayshift are complete. It&#39;s time to part ways.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This time...there were far too many Servants who had to die for us to get to this point.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> While I know parting is sad and painful, you still emerged victorious.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> You can return with pride. That&#39;s the greatest respect you can pay them.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes...Anyway, Nightingale,we&#39;ll be going now—</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Miss Mash. Before that, may I have a word?</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My wish is to eliminate hospitals from the world.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That is, adequate medical care being available in every home.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t think that, even after 100 years, it wouldn&#39;t have been achieved...</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> But there&#39;s one thing I still believe in. That someday, illness will be eradicated completely.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> No more patients will die filled with despair and resentment.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> I&#39;ll no longer have to oversee the final agonizing moments of soldiers that have respected me.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I fought. Both now, and forever into the future.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> There&#39;s no reason for you to feel any guilt. I did this for my own goals.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> You too must continue to live...for yours.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Yes. Thank you very much, Chief Nurse.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Miss Mash. Dreams and wishes are different things.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> My wish isn&#39;t my dream. The moment people classify something as a dream, they misunderstand it as something far away.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Constantly facing reality, understanding the numbers, and fighting thoroughly is what opens a path to one&#39;s wishes.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Sobbing must be trampled, resignation must be crushed. –That is the one and only path that humans can walk.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Master. I have as much trust in you as my kindred spirit, Sidney Herbert.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Please, continue to support Miss Mash. May there always be light along your path.</p><p><strong>Nightingale:</strong><br> Farewell. I look forward to the day we meet again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...The path to one&#39;s wishes...is opened by fighting...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Ahem, it seems I&#39;m the last. Mash, Master...</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> My wish has not been fulfilled yet, but still...I&#39;m proud of many things that happened during this battle.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> I was able to rescue Sita. In record time, no less.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> But above all, I was able to meet you. I find this bond as precious as Sita and my younger brother Lakshmana.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> If I could become your Servant once again,that would bring me the greatest joy possible.</p><p><strong>Rama:</strong><br> Thus, this is the only thing I have to say. –May we meet again!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. See you again!</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...So it was no good.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...No, that&#39;s not true.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> ...I&#39;m quite surprised.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Taking a lethal wound and still surviving is how a Servant is, and how I am.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> All that means is some of the skills I&#39;ve acquired over my long life have proven useful.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Still, Cú Chulainn really was the strongest. Even though their timing was impeccable...To think they could actually defeat him...</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I should say I&#39;m impressed.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Now then, that leaves just one more promise–</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> Very well, I&#39;ll fulfill my agreement. Although, now with the Holy Grail&#39;s power gone, this world is correcting itself.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> There&#39;s time for a single round at most–</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind. After fighting with Beowulf,I think a single strike is my limit now.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> Your proposition is convenient for me, if anything.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...I see. Although simply vanishing would be less painful, I&#39;d imagine.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> A chance to fight the famed queen of the Land of Shadows? If I miss this chance, it&#39;ll probably be gone for eternity.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind if it&#39;s just a single round. Scáthach, do you happen to know my nickname?</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> ...Yes. Your nickname means that you only need one strike to defeat any opponent. Something that any warrior would admire.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> “No Second Strike”– If so, I shall put everything I have behind this single strike as well.</p><p><strong>Li Shuwen:</strong><br> –Heh. I&#39;d want no less.</p><p><strong>Scáthach:</strong><br> –Very well.</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> An honest–</p><p><strong>Both:</strong><br> Match!</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> –Hey, you managed to pull through again, somehow.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> This means the United States of America, a nation essential to history, was successfully established.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> In any case, good work. We&#39;ll secure the Holy Grail that you recovered.</p><p><strong>Dr. Roman:</strong><br> Both of you should go back to your rooms and get some rest. I&#39;ll tell you about the next plan later.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Understood, Doctor. Let&#39;s get going to our rooms, Senpai.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> May I ask something? Many sad things happened on this journey, as always.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s why it might be a little–inappropriate, to say something like this.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But...I&#39;m having fun.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Travelling to different parts of the world and eras with you. We meet many people and heroes.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> This time, we went to America, and got to meet regional heroes like Geronimo and Billy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> And we got to witness Nightingale&#39;s incredibly strong conviction.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Putting good and bad aside–even the enemies we met with possessed vivid personalities, in their own ways.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...It&#39;s amazing. I&#39;m sure no mage could experience such a journey.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our journey will never go down in history. It&#39;ll be one engraved only within our memories.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I want to cherish these memories forever and ever.... That&#39;s how I feel.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I feel the same.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s cherish them.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Anyway, I&#39;ll be going now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t lie down right away just because you&#39;re tired.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You should take a shower to relax your body before going to sleep.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yup. Good night, see you tomorrow.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You did well, Mash.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Let&#39;s do our best next time too.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Sen...pai...S-Strange...I can&#39;t...stand—</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Mash?</p><hr><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou! Fou, fo—u!</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Singularity/america.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
