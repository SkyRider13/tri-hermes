# Nasu and Takeuchi's 7th Anniversary interview  
  
---  
  
## Revising development structure issues that went years unaddressed  
  
**Famutsu:** It's been a hectic year for Mr. Nasu, with the enormous Lostbelt 6 and the first half of the remake.

**Nasu:** It sure was... And it'll stay busy for as long as FGO is running. This year I also had to work on LB7 and supervise 6.5, so it's less work than last year but I'm still fighting for my life. But as everyone guessed, I did take a break from February 25th to March 2nd.

**Famutsu:** I can tell from the date that it was an Elden Ring break (laughs). Were you satisfied with the game?

**Nasu:** I was pretty much like "I have the perfect game I dreamed of as a child before my eyes, what I am doing let work consume all my time?! If I don't immerse myself in it now, what's even the point?". Though even during the break, I was still proofreading things. Only my own writing went on a break for me to explore my game in its depths.

**Famutsu:** Must have been a nice refreshing point. How has your year been, Mr. Takeuchi?

**Takeuchi:** LB6 was a critical moment for Nasu, as we all know, but it was also critical for me as a member of the development staff. And we from Type-Moon also had Tsukihime to work on alongside FGO, so I was feeling pretty burnt out by the end of it.

**Famutsu:** Yeah, that's what two projects in parallel do to you.

**Takeuchi:** Also, while this didn't affect the Type-Moon side much, we switched developers from DelightWorks to Lasengle, and in this shift, they revised the development structure. They planned a workflow that removes excess weight from unnecessary parts, allowing us to continue this project for a longer time.

**Nasu:** For the past 6 years, no staff member could help outside of their own designated sector. We always considered this system a problem and kept asking them to fix it, to no avail until now.

**Famutsu:** Must have been hard to switch companies when the workflow is nonstop.

**Takeuchi:** LB6, our biggest project yet, was a good opportunity to confront these topics. We couldn't keep avoiding it if we want FGO to continue until its natural endpoint.

**Nasu:** And that was the moment we chose to restructure our development. We needed to change our model to lighten the load on each individual, so no one needs to stay up late working and get sick for it. It was only by the end of last year that our 6-year-long wish came true so I don't think the effects of it are showing on the game proper yet, but I'm satisfied with the fresh start we're given.

**Famutsu:** Sounds like LB6 was as much of a turning point to FGO's production as it was for its story.

**Nasu:** For what comes after LB6, we've been implementing things I don't believe we could have done if we weren't upgrading our work conditions in parallel with 6's production.

**Famutsu:** Lately we've been seeing a lot of additions and improvements on the gameplay side. Was that also caused by the restructuring?

**Nasu:** The gameplay didn't change because the team changed. I mean, these gameplay changes have been happening every year. It's wishful thinking to believe you can change a game's gameplay by simply getting a new team. All changes happened because things that started in advance were seen through to their completion.

**Takeuchi:** Yeah, this is just the moment when what we prepared finally took shape.

**Nasu:** For example, if it weren't for some delays, the Append Skills would have been implemented the day Part 2 started.

**Famutsu:** I see, so you just put that in the game whenever you found the chance.

**Nasu:** But I have to add: we didn't spend all of last year on those little details. We're working on much more drastic changes. Things we didn't want to touch because we were afraid it would ruin the game's balance, but now they've gotten too outdated to stay the way they are. I believe some things need to change, no matter how much of a strain they may cause.

**Takeuchi:** Every one of us wishes to fix the game aspects that aged poorly. And when the fruits of those wishes come together, you may find major changes in the gameplay loop.

## The pros and cons of disclosing information   
  
**Famitsu:** Next, can you tell us more about the most memorable events of the past year?

**Nasu:** This is by no means a rare answer, but I consider Gudaguda to have been the most surprising. It was a well-produced event with a tightly knit plot and cast. The players also loved it. But I think that one that played its part the best was Traum. It had big shoes to fill as chapter 6.5, and I think it pulled off splendidly.

**Famitsu:** Takasugi Shinsaku appeared in Gudaguda as a NPC. Always he always planned to be that way?

**Takeuchi:** NPCs are an essential element to breathe more life into the stories and give players more to enjoy. We've been including NPCs in the game since launch under that belief, but after seeing the number of charming NPCs introduced in LB6, we've become more proactive in our wishes to make more NPCs. It's a matter of timing; Takasugi and Takechi's story happened to match the days we started committing to this new direction.

**Famitsu:** Among those, Takasugi was the one who garnered the biggest response, from what I've seen.

**Takeuchi:** He was. We all know his design is gorgeous, but I think it was his role in the plot and Takasugi's fame that made the response to him reach so far above our expectations.

**Famitsu:** Traum is another one with many interesting NPCs. Will they be NPCs again in future stories?

**Takeuchi:** Nothing I can say about it yet. We're truly glad people are attached to the characters we introduced as NPCs. Not everyone can be made playable but I hope to deliver on the audience's expectations. We will reevaluate what we can.

**Famitsu:** Next, tell us what was the most memorable Servant of this past year.

**Takeuchi:** Hmm. There're many, but the number one is Koyanskaya of Darkness. She was originally only going to be one character, and we had the three Ascensions designed for her, but considering the light and dark dichotomy, we made her into two characters, split the designs among the two, then filled the blank with new designs.

**Famitsu:** Yeah, Wada Arco's designs were fantastic.

**Takeuchi:** She would be the centerpiece of both Anniversary and New Year, so I asked Wada to give her a really hype design, and I can confidently say what she delivered was the peak of the Tamamo-variant designs. Wada also designed her Beast form for us, and that was also incredible. She turned out a very memorable character with the way she combined our memories of our journey on the Lostbelts.

**Famitsu:** What about you, Nasu?

**Nasu:** The Trung sisters for me. A Servant by Take has been a big dream for me, and we got a design that amply shows off her strong suits. I was seriously worried we wouldn't be able to reproduce the effect in their battle sprites, but the battle team did a splendid job. Their debut story in the Sea Monsters Crisis event was also super good.

**Famitsu:** That ending CG really pulls your heartstrings.

**Takeuchi:** Take put so much heart into that character's design. Everyone on the staff, me included, wanted to live up to her feelings. Together with the Trung sisters, Take also designed the welfare Taisui Xingju, which is essentially two characters in one with his child and adult forms. That's a lot of work for one event.

**Famitsu:** That's already 4 characters in the same event. But what about the Con NPCs? Weren't they by Take too?

**Takeuchi:** They were. Because Taisui and the Cons are one and the same. We ended with a pretty well-polished event, due to some points where Take accepted requests anyone else would have refused. That final CG was a very last-minute commission, but she said yes despite her busy schedule.

**Famitsu:** The Sea Monsters Crisis got me thinking about how difficult it is to write Morgan. She can solve all problems and beat the boss on her own.

**Nasu:** When the event writer sent me their plot plan and I read "Morgan appears", I just went "Heh, they're going with Morgan" and didn't think much about it. Later, when I read their finished script, my reaction was "Huh, she's kinda hard to write". The ultimate solution was to have Morgan, Ereshkigal, and Meltryllis get the Nasu rewrite. I thought it was still too early to go with Morgan, but after all's said and done, I think she added a nice flavor to the soup.

**Famitsu:** What a lady, staying away from the event's story until she got her moment at the very end. Also, this event didn't reveal its reward Servant until it was over. That was unusual.

**Nasu:** I believe having welfare characters is the main motivator to make players try the event, so I was really afraid people wouldn't feel inclined to play if they didn't know who the welfare was. But for Sea Monsters Crisis, we had to hide him. I wanted to hide even the fact that there was a welfare unit, but considering the risk to player engagement, we couldn't. We revealed only that the welfare existed.

**Famitsu:** That was a little gamble, I see.

**Nasu:** I was afraid people would get confused and misunderstand the statement as "the Servant will never tell you their name", but that's where you have to trust your audience. If they read the story, they'll understand our welfare choices.

**Takeuchi:** Some past events didn't have welfares when the players thought there would be one, and the comments from disappointed players were nonstop. When there is a welfare, we have to say there is, or else we'd be disappointing them further, and we don't want that. However, not revealing who the welfare is worked well this time, so we want to try it again.

## This was the only chance to release Roland  

**Famitsu:** Now I'd like to start asking questions about LB6, its de facto side-chapter Tunguska Sanctuary, and 6.5. What was Muramasa's reason to accompany the group into the Inner Sea? Merlin's words were quite obfuscating.

**Nasu:** That's because Merlin was betting on the idea that Muramasa would ultimately choose to sacrifice himself. But Muramasa went far beyond his predictions. Merlin's human observation skills still take a lot for granted (laughs).

**Famitsu:** He was thinking that many steps ahead, you say? Arthuria Caster was the one supposed to become the Holy Sword essence. Are there any consequences to Muramasa taking her place?

**Nasu:** No, Arthuria Caster IS the essence. Muramasa just took over the job of delivering the final touches... solidifying the Holy Sword. Arthuria Caster was able to accompany Chaldea later because she still had the last bits of magical energy she was supposed to have used.

**Famitsu:** How are the Pan-Human Cernunnos and the beast god priestess doing?

**Nasu:** I'd say Cernunnos passed ages ago and is now enjoying a leisurely retirement in the world of gods on the other side.

**Famitsu:** I got the implications that the Lostbelt version of the beast god priestess was put in a state where she couldn't die. What happened to her next?

**Nasu:** I'm pretty sure all parts died when we busted the human factory. She was already dead as a human being, and her bio functions were each being exploited in a different sector of the factory. They were just using a corpse, which is ethically okay from the fae's perspective. A higher order lifeform, however, would get really mad at that and lament how the sanctity of the soul is in shambles.

**Famitsu:** Why was the beast god priestess the only human on Earth to survive the collapse of the continents?

**Nasu:** Cernunnos said "I'm very concernnunos about this dangerous battle, so I'll retreat to Avalon" and took his priestess with him. Later he thought "It's been long enough. The Holy Sword must have already ended the battle. This can't continnunos forever.". So he came back and it was all destroyed. "We're donnunos for".

**Famitsu:** Does Pan-Human History also have an Abyssal Insect?

**Nasu:** Good question. He should exist everywhere the concept of "hole" exists, but nothing that vicious will ever manifest there.

**Famitsu:** Is there any reason why Morgan used to have Arthuria Caster's appearance?

**Nasu:** Because they're two products with the same model number.

**Famitsu:** So you mean Arthuria Caster will look like Morgan when she grows up?

**Nasu:** Her appearance changes little by little according to the environment where she's raised, so I can't say they'd be identical, but at the very least, their standard forms wouldn't be much different from each other.

**Famitsu:** On another note, Koyanskaya was intending to take in the Alien God as her 8th tail. Would she succeed if she hadn't taken Cernunnos's attack?

**Nasu:** Depends on what you're interpreting "Alien God" as, but yes, she could. She can absorb anything with hair. But only if she became a complete Beast. Because she made herself as a copy of the source of the chimimouryou and has been leveraging that property of her original to its best effect.

**Famitsu:** Why was Koyanskaya so supportive of Muryan?

**Nasu:** Because she was aware that the two of them were alike. They were both the only individual of their respective species but still shared the superior knowledge and intellect necessary to build a city and a corporation. That commonality strengthened their friendship. Even so, Koyanskaya imagined that Muryan would curse society in her closing act since that was the logical conclusion of being the same as Koyanskaya. Yet, Muryan's very last wish wasn't revenge, it was to protect the world she lived in. From this moment, Koyanskaya was already feeling her defeat. As a gesture of admiration for Muryan and respect for their friendship, Koyanskaya chose the route of protecting Chaldea once. Koyanskaya didn't want to protect Chaldea. She did it for her magnificent friend, to not let her life go unrewarded. I'll go into a little bit more detail about it in the book I'll be selling on this year's summer Comiket.

**Famitsu:** Koyanskaya has many sprites, including some that aren't playable. How are those going to be handled going forward?

**Nasu:** We want to include them, the people love them, but Koyanskaya has so many Lostbelt fashion pieces that we tragically have to hold back...

**Famitsu:** Next, tell us more about the Wandering Sea mage that appeared in Tunguska Sanctuary's epilogue (Fabro Rowain). Is he a Dead Apostle (the Nasuverse version of vampires) like Nrvnqsr Chaos from Tsukihime?

**Nasu:** He's a normal mage. Although his body is very close to unaging. The Wandering Sea mage was there for fanservice, and because we had to show what he looked like since it wouldn't be very nice to keep him on his voice-only appearances forever.

**Famitsu:** How long has Takeuchi gone without drawing him?

**Takeuchi:** Really, really long. Nrvnqsr Chaos was known for being naked under his cloak, but I don't think that would roll well with FGO's current audience. That's when I thought "Why not give him a more sci-fi look?" and tested out a somewhat alien outfit. It was everything we needed. We ultimately made him fit in without straying too far away from his Tsukihime incarnation.

**Famitsu:** He referred to Sion as the "Bird of the Netherworld". Does that mean he knows what happens in other timelines?

**Nasu:** He observes parallel worlds, so he should know. He knows that that's a transformation that happens in every timeline when Sion's life reaches its end.

**Famitsu:** FGO's Sion is a hematophage but not a vampire, right?

**Nasu:** It's a matter of life choices. "Bird of the Netherworld" here doesn't mean she'll get her boss design, it means that she will always hold on to the associated beliefs in the moment of her death.

**Famitsu:** In chapter 6.5, Roland reappeared for the first time since Astolfo's "Waiting for Roland" Interlude. He's now playable after 5 years as an NPC.

**Nasu:** That's because this was the last chance left to put him in (pained laughter). He's been ready for the longest time, but every time we thought "do we need to include him here?", it never felt like he was a must-have in the plot. And so, his development stopped at the 80% mark, then we spent 5 years waiting for an appropriate opportunity to release Roland.

**Famitsu:** I thought you had just forgotten him (laughs).

**Nasu:** 6.5 was initially planned as a story about the French Revolution, but the chapter writer proposed that if we wanted to go all out, he'd like to write a war among many Servants. Later he decided that he had to go with the paladins for this, and so we made the last-minute decision to implement Charlemagne.

**Takeuchi:** When Roland appeared as an NPC, his playable profile was already complete. We simply weren't lucky with opportunities to include him this whole time. We had many other characters in his wait-for-release situation, but Roland is the one who's been there the longest.

**Nasu:** Either him or Red Hare. Also, Jane was part of the launch roster, but her release extended all the way to Saber Wars II ~ To The Initial Universe~. Jane, Red Hare, and Roland are the Three Musketeers of Being Planned From The Start and Not Having A Good Place to Be Included.

**Takeuchi:** By the way, to put Roland on the Interlude, we made his illustrator, Sakamoto Mineji, rush his design. And yet, we put him on hold for years... I felt so bad when informed them of Roland's release and their response was "I drew that 7 years ago". It hadn't hit me how long it had been...

**Famitsu:** I'd like to ask about the other Servants in 6.5 too. Do the nameless Servants also get their lore profiles?

**Nasu:** I asked the writers about it and got sent a rich list of character notes. But since they weren't people who actually left their names in his history, there's no case where one of them will turn out to be some famous hero you know. They are nothing more than second-string soldiers who couldn't manage to become first-string soldiers but were successful in their second-string roles.

**Famitsu:** That oath-breaking monk Archer didn't reveal her name, but is there any hope for a future role for her? Maybe at the next event, or...

**Takeuchi:** It won't be at the next event (laughs).

**Famitsu:** But you're confirming her part here was just an early cameo?

**Nasu:** Yeah. You can imagine how desolate Traum would feel with just the class name Servants, so we brought in some named ones for variety. We tried to choose figures that would be not too strong, but also not too obscure. Someone people would recognize from the name.

**Famitsu:** At the end of 6.5, Holmes met a tragic end, but in a way that's meant to call back to Epic of Remnant's PV, correct?

**Nasu:** Correct. After 3, 4 years, my vision for that is finally public. Who summoned him? Before that, why the evidence traces back to before 2017? Those were the big questions the players were supposed to ask themselves. But now the audience solved the case and their doubts were pushed to the corner of their minds. That's the current state I aimed for. But rewatching the PV now, I'm still taken aback by how evil Holmes's voice sounded... (laughs)

**Famitsu:** So that twist was planned from the start.

**Nasu:** I believe that in 1 year you'll know why things had to be the way they are. It'll all make sense. One thing though, the turning point with Holmes was planned to happen in LB7. That's one part that deviated from the plan.

**Famitsu:** A younger Moriarty appearing in 6.5 was another big surprise.

**Nasu:** He wasn't planned to appear, actually. He just spawned into reality because Takeuchi said he want to see a younger Moriarty.

**Takeuchi:** Yup.

**Nasu:** When we first heard about it, everyone in the writer team had the same reaction. "A young Moriarty? Awesome, but where do we include him?". It was too hard to find a moment for him. And here's where the young Moriarty's writer came up with a character for him as the true boss who defeats Holmes in 6.5. That's the story of how Holmes got his farewell in advance.

**Famitsu:** Mr. Takeuchi, why did you want a younger Moriarty character?

**Takeuchi:** When we had a meeting to discuss future Servants, we got to the topic of releasing alts of pre-existing characters, and that was one of the ideas brought up there. The two words "Young Moriarty" were all it took to fill the head of the designer Honjou Raita with all sorts of ideas. Moriarty turned out to be quite the juicy character in his younger days.

**Nasu:** Young still has one major role to play. I'll stay quiet about it for a while, but you'll see him again eventually.

**Takeuchi:** He is one of my favorites. Characters drawn by Raita always have sexy bodies and wonderfully implemented gimmicks, and Young Moriarty is no exception. I believe he's a character who made the fans of Raita's male characters go crazy.

## A simpler story. Lostbelt 7's writer is Nasu Kinoko.    
  
**Famitsu:** If you have nothing else to say before we move on to the future of FGO, I'd like to ask first about this year's summer event.

**Nasu:** After our years of ghost stories, treasure hunts, and other off-standard motif choices, I want to return to the basics. A nice ocean, a blue sky, and a fun amusement park.

**Famitsu:** Mr. Takeuchi, is he lying?

**Takeuchi:** (laughs)

**Nasu:** There is an ocean! Not an ocean they can swim on, BUT it looks really pretty in contrast to the blue sky. It'll be a feel-good event. The location was already revealed in-game.

**Famitsu:** I must have missed it. Also, give us a recap of the year so far.

**Nasu:** It will click when you see the title. This year, we're doing a story about having fun at a beach resort. No hidden masterminds like in previous summers, and no theme shifts like ServaFes. That said, every featured Servant, even the most orthodox-looking one, has a big surprise. Another big thing is that there'll be 3 SSRs. We couldn't fit all our roster in just 2 SSR slots, so we made a third one. Look forward to it.

**Takeuchi:** Also FGO will get introduced to a woman very similar to Merlin (Prototype) from Arcade (laughs) while Arcade gets Merlin.

**Nasu:** It's a trade. ProtoMerlin is a daughter we married to the Arcade family shortly before the pandemic because we wanted to push that product, but now it's been two years, so with this event, we decided it's already been enough time and she can come to mobile.

**Famitsu:** Many players are looking forward to her.

**Takeuchi:** Not trying to imply anything about the story, but I hope you enjoy her. And hope the location was something you hadn't thought of before.

**Nasu:** The summer events were produced with the intention of providing nice summer festival simulations for those players too busy to go to the beach or the mountains in real life. The downside is that the more we do them, the fewer suitable situations we're left with to do next (laughs). We're already brainstorming what kind of leisure we can use for next year and the one after that.

**Famitsu:** Looking forward to the reveal! Next, I'd like to talk about what is in LB7.

**Nasu:** I might be starting to sound like a broken record on this one, but the general storyline will be REALLY simple.

**Takeuchi:** Sure, anything is simple compared to LB6 (laughs). But don't worry, we have some interesting arrangements planned for it.

**Nasu:** I really didn't want to say it before, but now it doesn't matter anymore, so I'll tell. LB7's writer is Nasu. I kept quiet about it because if a potential personal tragedy happened before May of this year, I wouldn't be able to write it and would have to assign it to someone else.

**Famitsu:** Very excited about it, knowing it's a Nasu work. Things will be crazy with both Rasputin and ORT there.

**Nasu:** No, I just told you they're going to be normal (laughs). LB6 was an outlier and won't happen again. LB6 just happened to be among the Top 3 Insanest Nasu Products and I can't make that the standard if I want things running long-term.

**Famitsu:** I just get really hyped imagining what that will look like. What should we be expecting for FGO's 8th year?

**Takeuchi:** For this 8th year, we're working hard on LB7's production. As Nasu mentioned, putting a different form of effort from what we put in LB6. What happens after LB7 is a topic we've been approaching since last year and now we're finally 100% sure about the direction we'll take. We're finally in a position where we can take that last sprint to the climax. We're going full throttle, and we hope this is evident enough to the players.

**Nasu:** The upcoming LB7, much like the 7th Singularity, is a point where we semi-settle the whole journey so far and all the foreshadowing associated with it, in a way the solution to the plot becomes visible. Unless something changes drastically, I believe things shouldn't come as a surprise for someone who has been playing this for 8 years. I want to present a different form of excitement, one with an unusual arrangement that still offers a lot of enjoyment even after the novelty of the gimmick runs out. The development environment is really tense, with everyone focusing all of their energies on this.

**Famitsu:** So basically, we can assume LB7 will answer all of Part 2's mysteries?

**Nasu:** Not necessarily answer, but it will give you a good grasp of the bigger picture of it. There's still a final chapter to do after it, so some doubts need to remain. But I believe LB7 will reveal a major starting point to the whole situation, or rather, a resolution plan that no one considered before.

**Famitsu:** By the way, you've been providing .5 extra chapter between every Lostbelt since 5. Will the story feature chapter 7.5?

**Nasu:**** You will know when you finish LB7. Please be patient. All I'll say is:** remember my statements in the post-LB5 interview. "We're finally 1/3 done with it." "Don't think you've reached the halfway point yet." ... (laughs)

**Famitsu:** In a previous interview, you mentioned two options for what happens after part 2 (A - A sequel to part 2's story, or B - Part 2 is the definitive end to Chaldea's story and a new story begins). Any changes to your present plans?

**Nasu:** Not really. I personally want to go with A, but it all depends on how the audience will respond to it, so God knows what will actually happen.

**Famitsu:** Tell me about what you're doing other than FGO. Anything you can disclose about Mahou Tsukai no Yoru's console port, Tsukihime's second half, or Fate/EXTRA Record?

**Nasu:** I wish Takeuchi would tell ME.

**Takeuchi:** Fine (laughs). Mahou Tsukai no Yoru is taking priority over Tsukihime, so it's progressing at a steady pace. Mahou Tsukai no Yoru is based on a novel Nasu wrote when he was 20, and since I first read it, it has always been one of my dreams to spread this story to a larger audience, to have as many people as possible enjoy it. The movie adaptation is only one out of multiple projects I'm considering to increase its reach, but it's important to enjoy the game version first. Tsukihime and Fate/EXTRA Record are still being developed under wraps, so please wait for a future announcement!

## What are Nasu's and Takeuchi's highest-level Servants?    
  
**Famitsu:** Sorry for the abrupt change of topic, but tell us who are your level 120 Servants or the Servants you want to raise to 120?

**Nasu:** Level 120 is a distant dream~(laughs). I generally believe taking Servants above level 100 is something only for those who are really into that, but I'm trying to raise all Mooncancers to 100 or higher. BB is 100, Jinako is 100, Kiara is 100. Raising Mooncancers to 100 is my grailing theme, my personal oath. But 120 is... not easy.

**Famitsu:** I know, I still only have one 120.

**Takeuchi:** We tried to make the mechanic into a practically endless journey, so I'm honestly flabbergasted by the number of players who reached level 120.

**Famitsu:** By the way, who are you leveling, Takeuchi?

**Takeuchi:** My Arthuria is still 116.

**Nasu:** If you just spend your natural AP every day without eating any apples, your character should be around 114 or 116. At least that's how it is for me.

**Takeuchi:** I'm tired of dumping so many embers for no visible progress... (laughs)

**Nasu:** You have it easy with Arthuria. I'm raising Extra Classes, so there are no class-specific embers to speed things up.

**Famitsu:** Gotta aim for those Super Successes.

**Takeuchi:** Yeah, it really feels like the Super Success rate-up periods are your only chance.

**Famitsu:** I noticed we've been getting new ways to obtain Holy Grails, but the Grail Forging was one mechanic that caught me by surprise. The game tells nothing about its principles and history behind its inclusion. Do you have anything to say?

**Nasu:** There's no lore behind it. It's simply that with the higher number of Servants, the players have a higher number of favorites, and our resource provision needed to catch up with that. The game has been running for over 5 years, so we need to prepare for more opportunities to give Grails. But they're still a special item, so we wanted to keep them limited to 1 per event, while also providing a special procedure to get more. What we wanted with the forging is for the player to discard many of something important to mold one of something also important, giving the feeling that it's not something you gained, it's something you made.

**Famitsu:** Something we personally made... Not another one of the many things Leonardo da Vinci made for us.

**Nasu:** I believe the Master is simply melting material, the resources they gathered, in that room. As I mentioned multiple times, FGO's Holy Grails are nothing more than a copied code, so there's no special magic secret to them.
