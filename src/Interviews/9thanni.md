## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 1 (On gameplay)

Famitsu: I’d like to begin by recapping the past year. How was the 9th year of service?

Nasu: The main thing about the 9th year is that it was when Part 2 finished its 7th Lostbelt and began Ordeal Call, the last bumper for the finale, so it’s been a year spent thinking about how to make people not lose interest. We’ve been putting effort into conveying to the player that Ordeal Call is something necessary to the narrative, rather than a filler arc, while also making the event in between as enjoyable as FGO has always been. We also spent this time preparing to deliver new forms of engagement for players who already maxed all their Servants and don’t know what to do next.

Famitsu: Are you saying there will be new forms of gameplay?

Nasu: The biggest additions will be on a gameplay level, and I believe the players will approve the changes. I imagine myself looking back with pride at what we managed to make just in time for the finale. It might come as a shock to the players who only level up the 7 main classes. However, if that’s you reading this, know that you still have time. Raise as many different Servants as you can now.

Famitsu: I want a hint. Will Bond and Class Score matter a lot?

Nasu: They will. Also, how much your full roster is leveled. In the part 1 finale, we had a gauge-esque gimmick that directly converted Bond into ATK, but part 2 will have something bigger in its place. At this point, I hope I can have that playable somewhere next year, which brings back to my previous point about the 9th year being a year of preparation.


## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 2 (On Summer 2023)

Famitsu: I'd like to recap the first event after the 8th Anniversary. Where did the idea to make a sequel for Servant Summer Festival come from?

Nasu: The initial reason was wanting to make a festival everyone gets to participate in. The real life Comiket runs every year, so back when I was writing the first one, I wanted to make a second Servant Summer Festival with everyone when the line-up of Servants grew different enough. So I told the staff that we should make another one on FGO's final year, but Takeuchi made me move this plan up (laughs).

Famitsu: So is it possible there will be a third one after more Servants come out?

Nasu: …I wouldn't count it. Maybe. Unlikely.

Famitsu: You mentioned before that Takeuchi was one of the reasons why you released Cnoc na Riabh.

Nasu: We already had the summer Servants decided, but with Cnoc na Riabh joining it, there was no other option, we had to make the LB6 bonus epilogue instead. The initial ideas for ServaFes 2 was involved Morgan, one with her opening a bank, with her produce a new logo for the second edition, and so on. But then he said he wanted to release Aesc (Morgan) on that year's Anniversary and I answered "If we're releasing Morgan, ServaFes 2 has to be now". The only problem was that using vanilla Hawaii again would be a letdown, so I had to come up with a new ServaFes.

Famitsu: Ok, so that's how things came to be. 

Nasu: The first ServaFes was about making doujin, so I made the next one about being a regular con-goer. No good would come from doing the same thing again. And with that many LB6 members around, I thought an interesting game direction would be making a self-parody of it, complete with a prophecy and 3 bosses to fight. And that's the origin story of the Cernunnos Series.

Famitsu: Tell us how you came up with the Cernunnos Series.

Nasu: Once it was decided we were doing ServaFes again, we traveled to Hawaii for field research. While on a cruise there, I thought Seanunnos popping out of the water would be so funny (laughs). And if there's a Seanunnos, there must be also a Searnunnos. That's how the idea expanded. The last one is Ceasenunnos, named after his will to stop the conflict… His "cease" pun unfortunately gets frequently mistaken with "sick" since both are read "yameru", but that's not it, he is a response to all the conflict they were causing.

Famitsu: Back to the topic of Cnoc na Riabh, I'm curious about how she was summoned, since she's not a faerie who ever existed in Pan-Human History. Was that Arthuria Avalon's power?

Nasu: Despite their differing circumstances, AA and the Throne of Heroes are practically the same thing, meaning she has the same ability to forcibly dispatch personnel. With that, she made a spokesperson for Wandjina, with the same ability to understand the Natural Spirit's feelings. She could have picked any other faerie, but the choice was made not by a system, but by AA's personal favoritism, and she wanted Cnoc na Riabh to enjoy one more festival.

Famitsu: Morgan is a Lostbelt King exceptionally summoned to bolster our forces until Human Order is recovered. Would it also be possible to summon, say, Zeus to our ranks?

Nasu: The Lostbelts are not a factor here. Zeus already existed in Pan-Human History, so the one called would have been the Pan-Human version. Queen Morgan is a different case, since she's Lostbelt-exclusive in her origins.

Famitsu: From what I can tell, Lostbelt Kings have an ability like AA's, to dispatch beings from the Lostbelt into our world. What are the conditions for that?

Nasu: Interacting with you enough to bind your fates together. Basically what was done with the Faerie Knights: anyone who engaged directly with Chaldea is summonable in this period until the case is solved.

Famitsu: Are you implying we have some unavoidable farewells awaiting when Human Order is restored?

Nasu: That's how it's always been with Servants… And Lostbelt elements won't remain in Pan-Human History, so doubly so for them…

Famitsu: Hearing that makes me want LB7's King Camazotz sent to me immediately. Does he have any chance of being summonable?

Nasu: He interacted enough that he can be called if there's any reason for it. The problem is that I already used Camazotz to his full potential in LB7, so I'd rather let him keep resting.

Famitsu: Another point that got me curious was Lady Avalon's claim that if people discover her identity, she'll vanish into thin air, never to be seen again. How literal was that statement?

Nasu: Eh, that's just because she has no place in our world, since it already has a Merlin. She's shy, simple as that (laughs). After she disappears, if you phone Merlin asking for Lady Avalon, he'll answer "She's watching YouTube in the other room".

Famitsu: Oh, ok, it was nothing serious. That's a relief.

Nasu: But Lady Avalon is not legitimately part of FGO's timeline, which means that while she was exaggerating the "vanishing into thin air" part, she will eventually sneak back to her own world when Human Order is restored.

Famitsu: With Arthuria Caster (Berserker)'s 2nd Ascension being a bunny suit slash Alice dress, we're only one away from having bunny suits for all of Type-Moon’s 4 main heroines.

Nasu: Do you believe there's anyone in the world who doesn't find rabbits cute?

Famitsu: Are we going to see Arcueid's bunny suit later in FGO?

Nasu: I don't think so, Arc is already a bunny character by default… If she were to get a new outfit, I'd rather throw a curveball.


## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 3 (On Olga Marie)

Famitsu: Right after summer, the first Olga Marie Quest appeared. Tells us what got them implemented.

Nasu: I wanted an event where you could throw in all the Servants you raised, a challenging gimmick battle with 30 Servants. That was the initial concept. There was no need to make that a mandatory battle, but without content like this, there's no point to leveling Servants. Since Olga Marie would go a long time without screentime after LB7, we decided to implement that both as a reminder that she'll still be relevant and as a vehicle to do something significant with gameplay.

Famitsu: Is that some kind of foreshadowing for the aforementioned new gameplay to come in the 10th year?

Nasu: Correct. The new gameplay elements will probably unlock as soon as you beat all Olga Maries… be prepared.

Famitsu: Tell us more about her design. Why only Flare Marie has her right horn broken?

Nasu: It wasn't my decision, but I remember that while Takeuchi was designing them, someone suggested that at least one of them should have different horns. Just consider that this piece was missing when she was split into four. No need to overcomplicate it.

Famitsu: Flare Marie spent her screentime as an unspeaking threat. What was she thinking?

Nasu: She's got the mindset of a proper knight, so she's naturally willing to fight worthy opponents and doesn't bear much of a grudge against those she battles. A good conversation could have gotten her on your side.

Famitsu: How ironic that Flare Marie, the one who could have been an ally, was the first we fight.

Nasu: Yeah, she was the only one willing to cooperate even after being fully aware of their opposing responsibilities. The other ones would never join you, because even if you get them to understand you, they'll still value their status and the responsibilities attached to it more. That's where she majorly differs from the other three.

Famitsu: What was Aqua Marie handing us all those Presidential Badges supposed to accomplish?

Nasu: It all began when I said I wanted the second Olga Marie Quest to play like Gradius. You grab power ups as you advance through the side-scroller and the battle gets easier depending on which power ups you got, with the option not to take the ones you don't want. That was what expressing that through FGO's mechanics looks like.

Famitsu: The design of the Presidential Badges was strikingly similar to the Command Spells of the human Olga Marie.

Nasu: The Presidential Badges were designed after her Command Spells. Aqua Marie didn't have any real plans for them–-they were just an item meant to give the enemy a fighting chance. Just like how kings would make coins with their portrait on it to pay other nations (laughs).

Famitsu: Where do each of the Elements live, and what do they regularly do?

Nasu: One out of four is doing something really stupid, but the rest isn't really doing anything. In general, you don't need to think about the 4 Element parts of Olga Marie as anything more than enemies for the Olga Marie Quests. That said, while their story scenes are small, they always have her saying something really important at the end, and for that reason, people who did them before the finale will understand the plot better than people who didn't. But I am making it understandable enough for people who didn't.

Famitsu: You mean to say the last two are already under preparation?

Nasu: They are. One is enjoying the presidential life to the fullest, while the other genuinely hates humanity. 

## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 4 (On Mahoyo)

Famitsu: I’d like to ask a few questions about the Mahoutsukai no Yoru (Witch on Holy Night) collab. What got this project in motion?

Nasu: The idea of making the collab has been on our plans for the longest time. We couldn’t settle on a date for it for a plethora of reasons, but through a lucky assemblement of the jigsaw puzzle of scheduling, we decided to run it in May 2024. We’re initially planning on a lower effort event, but the season demanded a meatier script, so that’s what I wrote. I still hadn’t recovered from the summer event fatigue, but I wouldn’t take a no for an answer on this one (laughs). I was writing Nemo’s Christmas event at the same time, so it was tight, but I managed.

Famitsu: What was the plot you initially had in mind?

Nasu: I thought this was the moment to give the witch hunts proper coverage. In my mid 20s, I traveled to Germany and I remember seeing this ancient castle there, I think the name was Castle Neuschwanstein, so I thought that would be a nice place to do a Silent Hill plot. But somewhere along the way, specifically in October 2023, Takeuchi and I spent a few days in a hot spring inn together to discuss our future schedule… in that inn that smelled like the 80s, I was inspired. “That’s it, I need to make my version of The Housekeeper Saw It All… yeah, The Robin Saw It All!”. I instantly knew it would be a plot where Aoko gets murdered every day in a hot spring inn.

Famitsu: I see, an idea that wouldn’t have come to life if you hadn’t visited an inn with a strong retro aesthetic.

Nasu: Mahoyo is a story about that decade, so I also considered setting the event in that decade. That would leave us with an event catering to the Mahoyo fans while leaving the FGO fans without much to chew on, so I consulted Koyama and Takeuchi and they were both fine with that. But just to make sure, I presented multiple plot plan documents and they preferred The Robin Saw It All, so that’s what we went with.

Famitsu: By the way, what exactly is the situation being depicted in Shizuki Soujuurou’s NP animation?

Nasu: Only myself, Koyama, and the Lasangle staff who needed to hear my explanation to make the animation know.

Famitsu: Seeing those ruins on a snowy day makes me think of Aoko’s decisive battle. I’d love to hear more about it.

Nasu: You’re not getting anything from me. Believe it or not, Soujuurou’s NP animation is a version 2, and the first take started with something that made it easier to understand what’s happening and what he did. That would have been too direct, and he’s one guy who doesn’t have any need for flash and pomp, so I made them cut the first shot. Version 1 let you understand everything if you tried, and I can’t have that (laughs).

Famitsu: Also, the reveals about Soujuurou’s basal ganglia came where I least expected them.

Nasu: We decided that to do Mahoyo right, we needed something new to show to Mahoyo fans, or at least something that lets them reframe what they’ve seen before. That’s a spoiler, but the fans would infinitely prefer something exciting over a bland script that reveals nothing.

Famitsu: The grown up Soujuurou wore a glove on his right hand. Is that prosthetic or something like that?

Nasu: He did wear a black glove, huh. True. End of discussion (laughs).

Famitsu: There was also a scene where Kuonji Alice touches his right hand and apologizes.

Nasu: The Alice from the collab is the only one of them who is a person from 10 years after Mahoyo, meaning she knows the differences between the Soujuurou from her time and the Soujuurou from 10 years before. Not much more I can say.

Famitsu: Got it. Then tells us only what Alice was feeling at the time.

Nasu: She wanted to say “thank you for being safe and sound” but couldn’t get the words out of her mouth. She felt sorry, and she also felt grateful for what happened 10 years ago and for everything that happened now. It mattered to her because she didn’t get to say thank you the first time either.

Famitsu: Your comment about Alice’s 3rd Ascension on the Bamboo Broom Blog was “I’ll tell you eventually, when the next Night comes”. Are you planning a second collab event later?

Nasu: That was a statement of determination. My acknowledgment that I need to write the sequels, no matter in what format. But I don’t think there’ll be a second collab.

Famitsu: Considering how you’re running out of titles for collabs, are there any of the previous ones you’re considering making a second collab for?

Nasu: You think I don’t have anything left to collab with? I still have a lot. So many I feel like I’ll throw up (laughs). There is a title I want to make a second collab for, but those will be categorized as standard events.

Famitsu: The direction for the final battle against Only One/Number One - Shiny Star was incredible.

Nasu: The new replaces the old, the colored images replace black & white. I was really intent on producing that major scene where your attacks can hit and the nicest song is playing in the background. I made firm requests regarding screen composition on Shiny Star’s scenes. A lot of effort was put into designing similar bosses in the past (see the Demon Pillars, Cernunnos, and ORT), so to avoid being repetitive, I thought a simpler and more conceptual design would be better.

Famitsu: Oh, true, that was unusual.

Nasu: I wanted to make it so simple that you couldn’t believe it could destroy the world, and in contrast, the arena would be as colorful and lavish as it can get. **Lasengle and Takeuchi were considerably lost on how to handle this. I explained countless times and they wouldn’t get it, then they sent the first finished background and they were standing on a flat surface, which was not at all what I wanted, so I tried explaining it in less accurate terms and what the unsure Takeuchi submitted from that was exactly what I had first envisioned.**

Famitsu: Another huge surprise was seeing Ryougi Mikiya and Ryougi Mana at the end of the Mahoyo collab. Mana’s goodbye was framed as particularly significant. What was that trying to imply?

Nasu: She was giving her regards and wishing good luck, because she knows everything that happened in the inn and knows what will happen later with Chaldea.

## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 5 (On Id)

Famitsu: Is Pseudo-Tokyo, the setting of OC2, based on locations from the protagonist’s memories?

Nasu: **Yes, it has to be the protagonist’s memories. Important distinction: they’re based on memories, not on the actual locations.**

Famitsu: That raises a few questions about the characters in there.

Nasu: They’d be Servants and enemy characters directly pasted over people from the protagonist’s memories. I imagine they’re allocating people they met after post-Chaldea to relationship they had pre-Chaldea.

Famitsu: I couldn’t imagine the protagonist getting as affected as they did, but them being caught up in the spirit of revenge makes a lot more sense now knowing all of them were based on real people.

Nasu: Hating bosses and plot instigators is out of character for FGO’s protagonist. Inconceivable, if you ask me. However, in this chapter specifically, it was necessary. Anyone would thirst for revenge after the persons closest to them got killed. OC2’s theme is how does one engage with their desire for revenge. I chose this theme and asked the chapter writer to spice it up however she wanted, but imagine my surprise when she said she’d write a high school slice-of-life. But once I read the script, it convinced me that this idea would get the point across.

Famitsu: How did you choose which Avengers got to leave the narrative in OC2?

Nasu: The Avengers who officially appeared in Chaldea’s journey left the narrative, and the Avengers that not everyone has met got to stay. You know how everyone plays the main story, but answers tend to vary when it comes to events? The Avengers who debuted in those remain. And then there’s Angra Mainyu with a unique exception status because he always existed, contrary to the other Avengers who came to be as a consequence of Chaldea’s journey.

Famitsu: Tells us what the LINK LOST and LINK BAD status represent.

Nasu: We considered using DATA LOST, but the chapter writer argued that this would make them gone for good and asked to leave a loophole open: making it so that they can’t be called because the communication line is severed. And that’s our current state. We choose LINK LOST and LINK BAD with the intended meaning of “They won’t appear in the story again, but they didn’t really disappear, we just can’t connect to them, ok?”.

Famitsu: That’s a relief. In the main story, no new Alterego joined our party after OC1. Likewise, are we not going to get any new Avenger teammates in content set chronologically after OC2?

Nasu: I don’t think any will appear in the in main story again. But that’s not relevant for events, so they get their chances to shine over there.

Famitsu: When I first heard of Ordeal Call’s theme, I imagined all of them would be farewells like the one we got here, but the Alterego chapter wasn’t.

Nasu: You know how people’s definition of right and wrong are constantly varying from moment to moment? Sometimes you hate today what you loved yesterday. Alteregos are nothing more than different personas, so there’s no need to systematically discard them. Understanding them is enough. But lust for revenge is a flaw that needs to be isolated and removed from the system.

Famitsu: Ok, it won’t always be a goodbye.

Nasu: Exactly. I gotta admit that the end of the Avenger arc was something I didn’t fully believe until I saw it. Maybe that twist came a bit too early. I encouraged everyone in the writer team to show off their personality in Ordeal Call, just like they did in Epic of Remnant, and told them, “I know this may sound overblown, but try to write something that will be remembered as your personal masterpiece. I’m giving you unlimited time and budget for it.” We normally couldn’t get that many sprites made for a single update, unless they’re all done by the same illustrator. With everyone being drawn by a different person, there’s a lot of work to be done contacting each illustrator individually and fitting all of them into the schedule. But thanks to all this prep work, I believe what we’re putting out is showing off each writer’s personality even more than Epic of Remnant did.

Famitsu: Are you saying the next Ordeals will also be outstanding productions?

Nasu: I am. OC3 will be a surprise on many levels. You won’t see it coming. Look forward to it, because it won’t do anything that 1 and 2 already did.

## Nasu Kinoko's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 6 (On future content)

Famitsu: it was a huge shock to see Space Ereshkigal featured in the Anniversary banner, and as a Beast, no less.

Nasu: Remember how I said in last year’s interview that we wouldn't get any more Beasts “from Pan-Human History”? Space Ereshkigal is a Beast from the Servantverse, so that’s perfectly viable!

Famitsu: Fair enough (laughs). Are you taking this as an opportunity to flesh out the Servantverse further?

Nasu: Anything goes with the Servantverse, so I can always throw that in whenever it’s inconvenient for Earth (laughs). I also want to make Saber Wars 3 but that will depend on my schedule. At the present state, we still don’t know if it’ll be possible.

Famitsu: What will be the theme for this year’s summer event?

Nasu: The theme for this year’s summer event will be high-class tourism. It’ll feature 2 other Servantverse characters aside from Space Ereshkigal. And, how do I put it… I wasn’t trying to make it a full-blown Kinoko parade like the Mahoyo collab was, but that’s what it ultimately turned out to be…

Famitsu: Are you the writer, Nasu?

Nasu: The summer event will be a two-parter… kinda, sorta. I assigned the first half to the main event writer and the second half to myself. During this production, we’ve been in constant communication while deciding who does what.

Famitsu: We’re almost at the 10 year mark. What exciting news should we be expecting for it?

Nasu: Most games don’t last 10 years. Considering that, I believe both the producers and the players are starting to get burnt out. But those 10 years we spent together are all the more reason to provide you with a beautiful ending, and for that I’m lighting a flame on my tattered body and persisting. Not to a Fires of Rubicon level, though (laughs). 10 years is a large and round number that makes for a nice cutoff point, so I’m trying my best to make it so you’ll fondly miss these fun 10 years. I mentioned in last year’s interview that this would be a year of preliminary work, and now those preparations are finally done. Both Type-Moon and Lasengle are working hard toward the 10th Anniversary.

Famitsu: Hearing you say that really gets me feeling the end is soon. Is it really?

Nasu: Nothing is eternal, everyone will die someday. But I won’t be like “boom, it’s over”. FGO will finish its huge main story, and from there no one knows what will come next. Nothing concrete yet on that.

Famitsu: But I’m sure you have a personal idea of what that’ll be like, Nasu.

Nasu: Only minor thoughts… I still can’t guarantee anything. I’ve always been saying “Once part 2 is over, set me free. Leave me to rest in peace.” (laughs), but that’s not looking like a very real possibility.

## Niinou Kazuya's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview

Famitsu: We’re finally getting news, 2 years after the release of the new trailer in 2022. I can confidently guess that Fate/EXTRA Record’s development was considerably troubled.

Niinou: It took more [production] time than I hoped…! Since this is the first remake of my life, sorting out what to change and what can’t be changed has been a tightrope walk. Also, since it’s been 14 years since I produced the original, there were parts of the game’s basic system that needed to be remade.

Famitsu: What did you change and what did you not?

Niinou: The first order of priority was handling the story with a lot of care, as to not ruin the fond memories of the people who played and loved the game back then. We carried in our hearts that this was a remake of Fate/EXTRA, not a different game inheriting its name. We came up with the tricks to wholly preserve the overarching plot, the iconic dialogues, and the character work yet simultaneously making it feel meatier and more satisfying than the original was at its time. We’re making a lot of additions where things were lacking and visual direction improvements, because I replayed the original recently and it felt short and rushed. The Arena dungeons got a large-scale overhaul to feel less rushed. They’re heavily packed, although not all of them. I hope this part of the game will feel very new to fans of the original…

Famitsu: What gameplay parts had to be remade?

Niinou: Almost everything, if not actually everything. Without modern quality of life, the game gets annoying at best and unplayable at worst. To make an RPG modern enough to earn its 2025 release date, I had to forget the original for a moment and start from scratch. This remake is not trying to sell the appeal of a bygone era.

Famitsu: Many people discovered Fate/ through FGO and never played EXTRA. Did you make “tutorials” for these beginners?

Niinou: I did. Back when Fate/EXTRA was made, Fate/ didn’t have the ton of spin-offs it has now. EXTRA was made for hardcore fans of the original and didn’t say much more than “look up the parts you don’t get, play the older games”. Nowadays we have more and more people who came into contact with Fate/ and the general Nasuverse via FGO, so we adjusted the game to give digestible explanations of the lore wherever possible. We’re making the game wishing for it to work as an entry point to the Fate/ series.

Famitsu: And what’s your strategy to accomplish that?

Niinou: It’d take forever to explain it in proper detail, but one example of adjustment we did was taking a long and heavy infodump and splitting into 2~3 separate scenes to explain the concept in parts, and another example is having a lore element mentioned offhand in the story and progressively fleshed out as you ask NPCs about it. We also made new characters to expand Fate/EXTRA’s lore. They won’t interact with the central plot much but their screentime will enrich the lore and the ambience of the Holy Grail War. We’re adjusting little things so that even a first-time Fate/ player can feel like a proper Master.

Famitsu: Since this is coming to modern consoles instead of the PSP, I believe you have a whole new world of options for what you can include and express. Are there any elements you wanted since the first time, gave up due to hardware limitations, and made happen now?

Niinou: Hmm, not really… Making Fate/EXTRA didn’t really push the hardware’s capabilities, so I can’t think of anything. Naturally, hardware evolution came with much greater graphical quality, and we needed to step up our visual art and level of detail. Parts of the original story and visual composition looked stale or outright nonsensical on the improved visuals, and that was a real challenge to fix… Oh, I just remembered it! There was one matter of hardware limitations! The ambience of the school building and the tournament venue improved tremendously now that we can display so many more participants in them. Now we have participants in every place we can fit them.

Famitsu: The quality of the character models improved immensely. Tell us what you prioritized the most in terms of visual identity for the characters.

Niinou: In general, our art direction placed major importance in the idea of portraying Fate/EXTRA using the latest forms of expression. I asked Wada Arco how she would present the world of Fate/EXTRA if she was doing it for the first time today, and from that conversation, we settled on making it sharper, more muted, and more anime. All characters have been remade to look visibly more anime while preserving Wada Arco’s balanced aesthetics. Some characters got partial design changes in the process. We haven’t changed the essence of their images… or at least we tried not to… so it’d be great to see differences being well-received.

Famitsu: The PV included battle scenes, with the UI looking very different from how it did in 2020. The new UI seems to be for card battle, but why did you choose this format?

Niinou: I wanted combat to be like it is in the latest modern RPGs… Pushing that thought further, we decided to make a tactically easy-to-learn card game format. That’s an easy way to make every Servant play differently and have their pros and cons, and probably would be well-received, because I’ve been noticing the card game player population growing a lot lately. It lost some of the original’s do-or-die thrill, but it’s made with its own appeal derived from strategy and the synergy between Master and Servant. I think it delivers on its “What next, Master?” feel. We’re still fine-tuning this part, but we’re trying to make each Servant play immensely different from the others, so doing repeat playthroughs with a different Servant should be more enjoyable than it was in the original.

Famitsu: Any final messages to the fans waiting with bated breath for Fate/EXTRA Record?

Niinou: First of all, I want to apologize to everyone who has been waiting forever since the first presentation! This took dreadfully longer than I estimated… I’ve seen people worrying that it was canceled. I’m really sorry for the concern I caused. As you can see in the PV we showed the other day, we’re still making it, and we’re tuning everything many times over to make it a satisfying game to play. Trust me, the longer the wait, the better the game gets! And to the people who only discovered Fate/EXTRA recently, know that we’re developing a great anime-esque story-driven RPG with fun gameplay and a powered up version of Fate/EXTRA’s original story. I appreciate your continued interest going forward. When I told Nasu Kinoko, creator of the original game, that I wanted to produce a remake, the first thing he told me was: “Remakes never get remakes, so I ask you to do everything there is to do on this one”. I took his words to heart, and now the entire dev team is on its last spurt to release something that truly does everything there is to do. We’re working hard to give you a good game in 2025.

## Takeuchi Takashi's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 1 (on Mahoyo)

Famitsu: I'd like to review the 9th year of service. What was the year like for you, Takeuchi?

Takeuchi: I believe it was a densely packed year, starting with the ServaFes, and even more recently having collabs with Fate/Samurai Remnant and Mahoutsukai no Yoru (Witch on the Holy Night). On the flip side, it was also the last period of preparation before the long-awaited climax, and for that the production team has been searching carefully for all the small gaps it still needs filled.

Famitsu: What would you consider the most memorable story update or event in the 9th year?

Takeuchi: To no one's surprise, the Mahoyo collab. Doing this one some day was a Type-Moon imperative, and I've been on the lookout for the ideal opportunity. I discussed with Nasu what the event should be like and he submitted 3 drafts. The first was Mahoyo as an event within FGO. The second was Mahoyo's current plot inserted into FGO's mold unaltered. And the third was a story from 10 later, which was the one we used. It was like a class reunion episode.

Famitsu: What gave this script the edge over the other two options?

Takeuchi: Nasu put a note on the 3rd draft reading "the more passionate you are about Mahoyo, the more you'll appreciate this one". Reading these words and the actual contents of the note, I felt this was the only one that contained that "essence" a Mahoyo collab deserved. Type-Moon considers Mahoyo's release to be one of its ultimate goals, with Nasu and Koyama being particularly intent on not sullying it. Despite all that pressure, we managed to get it done to remarkably positive feedback.

Famitsu: What was the plot like for the two other options?

Takeuchi: The first was what Nasu mentioned in the Bamboo Broom Blog: the story of a witch hunt inside a castle, very similar in delivery to a standard FGO event. The second was Mahoyo's most iconic fight, the battle in the abandoned amusement park, directly transplanted into FGO. The second draft was the most effective way to advertise Mahoyo, so we kept it as a plan B, but in my opinion, that wouldn't have had the spirit of either Mahoyo or FGO.

Famitsu: Maybe you could have gotten a good story out of that if Chaldea intervened in that fight.

Takeuchi: Good point. If it were something like a redo of that fight, that could have been the draft we picked.

Famitsu: Mahoyo's characters appear in the event grown up. How did you discuss those with Koyama?

Takeuchi: With the plot plan in hand, the necessary designs were put in place through a process between only Koyama and Nasu. One grew up exactly as I imagined, while another had an unexpected appearance. It provided an amusing surprise.

Famitsu: Speaking of surprises, the scene with Ryougi Mikiya and Mana was a shocker. Was this your first time drawing Mana at that age?

Takeuchi: It probably was, considering she's smaller here than she was in Kara no Kyoukai: Mirai Fukuin. While Nasu writes a script, he very often makes scenes there weren't part of the plot plan, with Mikiya's and Mana's cameo being one of them. **Mid-production, he told me, "I want to add this scene at the end if you have the time to draw their sprites", and my answer was "Of course I’ll do it" .**

Famitsu: The fact that you drew brand-new sprites for two characters who are only in the screen for a second is another shocker, honestly.

Takeuchi: This is mainly a Mahoyo collab, but to a lesser extent, it's also something like a class reunion for the broader world Nasu created. To put out this kind of fanservice, you need to know where is the right place where it'll get them (laughs). You can feel Nasu's strength as a GM in the way he makes you think they won't get it, tells you "No, it's right here", and brings it out. I designed them wanting not to disappoint his whimsical heart.

Famitsu: Mana is remarkably more well-behaved here compared to how she was in her home series.

Takeuchi: It's an established plot point that she's still not recovered from her sickness. At first, I drew her more mystic and expressionless, but that was scaring me, so I redrew her cuter (laughs). I hear a lot of people were happy to see her, so that was rewarding.

## Takeuchi Takashi's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 2 (On Cnoc na Riabh and Takeuchi-designed characters)

Famitsu: Summer Cnoc na Riabh was made playable in the summer event, and the Bamboo Broom Blog informed me that this was your idea.

Takeuchi: Cnoc na Riabh's last breaths was the LB6 scene that made me cry the hardest, so I feel strongly about her. The debates on whether to make her playable started long before that. One of our first ideas was making the LB6 bonus epilogue event almost immediately after Avalon le Fae's conclusion, and back then, someone had already suggested making Cnoc na Riabh the welfare. There was a moment we made a competition for who had the best idea for what to do in the event, and while the hype was still high up, we would sometimes have less-than-rational discussions on what would be good to put where and what we wanted to see. It was in one of those meetings that we decided to make Cnoc na Riabh, Aesc, and others playable.

Famitsu: How early was the decision made definitive?

Takeuchi: We flip-flopped a lot on some parts, but if I recall correctly, the first line-up had Aesc as the welfare. Nasu argued that plot-wise, it was easier to make Arthuria Caster the welfare, but ultimately, we made a line-up with Cnoc na Riabh as the welfare and stuck with that.

Famitsu: Are there any other NPCs you want released, like Cnoc na Riabh was?

Takeuchi: Same answer as the fans: the number 1'd be Camazotz. And due to my special attachment to LB6's cast, I'd super appreciate getting Woodwose or the 3 goblin brothers.

Famitsu: Tell us the concept for Arthuria Caster's 2nd and 3rd Ascensions. We already asked about the 1st Ascension last year.

Takeuchi: I wanted the 3rd to be Arthuria Avalon, and the image of the elegant one-piece swimsuit came to my mind immediately. It's for the 2nd one that I didn't know what to do. Since Arthuria Caster is not a character who would draw emphasis to her sex appeal, I believed it was better to look for a different route. Nonetheless, a swimsuit shouldn't be completely desexualized.

Famitsu: And how did you get from there to the bunny ears outfit?

Takeuchi: I drew a veritable pile of 2nd Ascension design drafts, showed everyone for feedback, and one reply I got was "Why don't you make her wear bunny ears?". I didn't put faith in the idea. It was clearly too niche. But I did a test illustration for it, and you know what… It didn't look bad… From there, I was completely invested in the direction of making it a meme outfit. "If that’s how we're doing it, I might as well theme it after Alice in Wonderland", I thought… and turned out with that design. Nasu approved it, so it must have been the right answer.

Famitsu: Since we're only one away from having bunny ears for all of Type-Moon's 4 main heroines, I was convinced that you personally considered them essential.

Takeuchi: No, no, I'm more of a cat ears guy. It was because there is one staff member very passionate about bunny ears. He says stuff like, "With bunny ears around, nothing can defeat me!" (laughs).

Famitsu: Tell us more about Aesc the Savior (Aesc the Rain Witch)'s design.

Takeuchi: For the 1st, I follow the instruction to make a witch, and submitted a few design proposals, one with a modern witch style, one with a modern warrior style, one with something looking more like a military uniform, etc. And from those, Nasu chose the most relatively orthodox witch form. The 2nd design is what I wanted to draw the most, something catering to my unfiltered tastes.

Famitsu: The connection to Summer Baobhan Sith (Cait Cú Cernpriestess)'s 2nd Ascension was great.

Takeuchi: Maybe Nasu had imagined this connection, but the two of us designing the characters weren't talking about it to make them match. Amusingly enough, the two of us just had similar ideas at the same time and gave them the same round glasses and general feel. For the 3rd, it all started with the idea of giving her a white swimsuit to contrast with how her regular outfit is black. After multiple attempts, I came up with something that might look a bit too cluttered but has Morgan's personality. One of the main things I wanted to do for this one is the way her hair tone progressively changes between Ascensions.

Famitsu: Next, I'd like to ask about Uesugi Kenshin. Nasu told us you did not want to draw Kenshin. Why is that?

Takeuchi: The idea of releasing at 5☆Kenshin had been in discussion for a long time, but in my opinion, Nagao Kagetora's design was already perfect. I couldn't imagine multiple Ascensions for that character, so I postponed the job, sometimes by dodging questions, sometimes by telling to their faces that I didn't want to do it. However, it was decided that the next Gudaguda event was going to feature Takeda Shingen (Takeda Harunobu), so I felt left with no choice: I had to be professional and get to work, prepared to feel unsatisfied (laughs). For her 1st Ascension, I chose to fill her with ideas that could have worked for Nagao Kagetora. For better or worse, Kagetora is an off–standard character with generally nothing but smiles in her expression sheet, which means I couldn't draw as many face variations as I wanted to. Her 3rd Ascension removes this restriction, so I drew her as someone capable of making many different faces. I wasn't feeling good about any idea for her design until the moment I had to commit something, anything, to paper, but once I thought of flipping the black and the white in her hair, things started progressing more smoothly.

Famitsu: Did Keikenchi have any demands regarding her design?

Takeuchi: **When I told him I couldn't think of anything for the design, he answered, "Don't worry, we can just give her giant gun turrets". Keikenchi frequently gives detailed demands for the Gudaguda characters, including the ones that aren't mine. He's someone who knows exactly what he wants, so our character design direction discussions often turn into fights (laughs).

Famitsu: What do you wish you could have done differently on Kagetora's design?

Takeuchi: I want to say "nothing" because the wording of the question is coming off a bit strongly, but if minor tweaks count, I think I'd have showed her legs a little more if remixing the design today.

Famitsu: What was the concept for the modern design she gets on her 2nd Ascension?

Takeuchi: Just the tried-and-true "if the 1st is her combat outfit and the 3rd is what she looks like possessed by her god, the 2nd can be a casual outfit". I vaguely remember Keikenchi saying Kenshin gets a bike because Shingen rides a red sports car.

Famitsu: What led the E-Olga Marie card arts to be illustrated by other people?

Takeuchi: I was told that the enemy Olga Maries in the Olga Marie Quests were going to be recolors of the original to reduce the production workload. Hearing that, I also wanted to differentiate them by the horns and made the designs with the horn differences. Later, I asked Nasu for card arts by different artists to emphasize the differences between each Olga. After this conversation, I asked multiple artists to draw her how they would draw a humanoid kaiju, and that’s what you can find in-game. 

## 	Takeuchi Takashi's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 3 (On Id and Ciel)

Famitsu: I’d like to ask a few questions about OC2. There we have a large amount of newly-drawn characters, and even the protagonist gets a school uniform.

Takeuchi: I didn’t have the time to design this one, so I made Lasengle’s design team send suggestion drafts. I received around 20 drafts and chose the coolest uniform that wouldn’t be a repeat of a previous one. The female protagonist loose socks naturally also comes Lasengle. I hope that felt original, because it’s a design my head couldn’t have produced.

Famitsu: Was that the uniform that the protagonist wore before the story?

Takeuchi: Oh, I don’t know. The documents say it was designed for Ordeal Call, but it’s possible it was that same uniform.

Famitsu: Jeanne Alter told the Ruler Jeanne: “Tell the little one to get on with it. Also… Give the other one a good sock for me.” Does that mean you’re drawing a new Jeanne?

Takeuchi: I’m not drawing one, but look forward to the reveal of what this line means.

Famitsu: FGO’s initial policy involved not using CG illustrations, but OC2 included a sizable amount of them. I think it’s about time we got a gallery already.

Takeuchi: We’ll consider the possibility, because I agree with your opinion completely. I’d appreciate having an in-game gallery.

Famitsu: I really want this function. Why did the amount of CG illustration increase this much?

Takeuchi: We’re always trying to improve not only the writing and characterization, but also the story’s presentation, and this is one of the results of that need. If I were to say there is a dividing point, that’d be Avalon le Fae. Producing that changed how the team thinks, myself included.

Famitsu: Did you, Takeuchi, draw Kyrie’s death scene in OC2?

Takeuchi: **I did. Lineart by me and the rest of the process by the other Type-Moon illustrators. Both for Mash and for the da Vinci’s, characters by Type-Moon member Shimokoshi, I spent the production of their death scenes paying attention to how graphic they should ideally be.**

Famitsu: I love the expression on the protagonist’s face in the mirror after this moment ruins their mental health.

Takeuchi: Thank you. I had to test a lot of different compositions to find one that didn’t look merely illustrative.

Famitsu: I was told one of the Summer Servants revealed in advance for this year’s event will be Ciel. Has that been decided for a long time?

Takeuchi: We have a meeting where we decide which characters will be playable, and for the star of the show, the Anniversary Servant, sometimes we settle on one immediately, and sometimes it takes forever for us to decide. This year was one of those where we flip-flopped a lot, and someone in the meeting suggested Ciel. But Nasu and I spoke in sync, saying no to Ciel.

Famitsu: Can you tell us why not Ciel?

Takeuchi: Simple. She doesn’t make sense as FGO’s anniversary Servant. Arcueid’s surprise factor only works once, and even then, she only fit the bill after we forced her into the special role of Archetype:Earth. Despite that, the discussion continued toward how to release Ciel regardless, and our solution to that was making her a summer character from the Servantverse.

Famitsu: I didn’t think we’d ever get a Servantverse Ciel.

Takeuchi: For that reason, I made the base of her design a regular Ciel swimsuit, and advanced from there by adding all the sci-fi elements. Since overdoing it carries a risk of making Ciel fans feel like that’s not her, it took some fine-tuning to let her feel in place in FGO while also keeping her recognizable.

Famitsu: Are her Ascensions going to be majorly different from one another? In my wildest dreams, I hope for her to get a playable form naked under a cape, like she dressed herself in her Roa days.

Takeuchi: Now you’re asking for too much (laughs). But considering she is a summer unit, maybe we could have gone with that, actually. Ciel’s fashion style is completely combat-oriented, so I couldn’t imagine her getting too dolled up. Normally, my ideas for her skew toward combat outfits or styles more on the badass side, but I was told that there’s no changing the fact that she is one of the 2 main heroines of the first half of Tsukihime and that demanded that she wore a dress that didn’t let her look like the poor option when compared side by side with Arcueid. For that reason, her 3rd Ascension will be a dress no one has ever seen before.

Famitsu: Are you saying we’ll get to see a dress on Archetype:Earth’s level?

Takeuchi: I don’t know how to compare them in terms of “level”, but I suppose I can describe hers as outstanding. You know how Archetype:Earth goes Luminary and turns into a giant of light in her home series? This element gets mildly visible in her hair, and I’ve been considering what an ultimate form of Ciel would look like through a similar process of thought. Ciel has one of the greatest, if not the greatest, magical energy reserves in the whole world of Kinoko fiction. I designed her starting from the image of “so much energy that it erupts from the edges of her body no matter how she tries to contain the leaks” and imagining her dress from there.

Famitsu: I’m looking forward to it. Will it include any elements from Powered Ciel?

Takeuchi: Yes. Her Noble Phantasm and animations are full of references, so the Ciel fans can hold high expectations for that. The level of fidelity to the source material in her NP animations will keep up with the standards set by Mahoyo.

Famitsu: Any chance Seven is also appearing?

Takeuchi: Again, you’re asking for too much.

## Takeuchi Takashi's 9th Anniversary Famitsu interview - part 4 (On Ereshkigal and future years)

Famitsu: Tell us what led to Space Ereshkigal's playable debut.

Takeuchi: Before anything, we already had Summer Ereshkigal's playable debut as a major objective and a challenge. Summer Ereshkigal has always been a candidate for last year's ServaFes. However, Nasu considered her a challenging character to debut because he believes featuring Ereshkigal in a story means making her center of the narrative. We predicted that we wouldn't be able to find a rightful place for her in the ServaFes, so we opted for delaying her.

Famitsu: And now she takes the stage at long last?

Takeuchi: The wait was longer than it should have been, and to acknowledge that, we considered several ways to make her more significant while still being a summer unit, and our method of choice was releasing her classed Beast and as the Anniversary Servant. I believe it will make sense once you see the high quality of her design and card art. An artist's passion and ideas have already induced change in FGO before, and it happened again now. Illustrator Morii Shizuki offered us a lot, and I do mean a lot, of ideas.

Famitsu: Speaking of Morii, the FGO Material book contained a sizable amount of Caren pictures. Did he send about the same amount of pictures again?

Takeuchi: He certainly did. At the first round of evaluation drafts, he already had a pile of amazing ideas up to the roof, and as we moved along the process, he continued to constantly change them. Every change would birth some new idea or spike his enthusiasm. My impression of him as an artist who is always aiming to be better and update himself increased with each step on the way, and Space Ereshkigal as a character became a culmination of his feelings.

Famitsu: Tells us if Morii's passion actually changed the way she was handled in any tangible way.

Takeuchi: Her affinity mechanics in combat (laughs).

Famitsu: Her what mechanics?

Takeuchi: Through your Skill usage and her reactions in combat, Ereshkigal gains affinity points for that battle. Her abilities change according to how many you have. At first, Morii sent us the idea of changing part of her NP animation with affinity. Something that we were thinking about including just as a hidden stat made into the game as a whole combat mechanic. Naturally, the original idea of changing her NP animation at max affinity also made it into the game. **One example of an idea that we got from Morii is that when attacking in 3rd Ascension, almost subliminal images appear animated in the background. The dev team calls that Beast Flash.**

Famitsu: With something on that level added to the roster, I can imagine the other artists will start making more suggestions for specific visual effects they want.

Takeuchi: The storyboarder was trying to fit in as many of the artist's ideas as possible. He welcomes anything that looks interesting enough. Morii more often than not gives us ideas completely alien to the conventional rules, so there's always something new and original with him, and the Beast Flash this time is an example of this.

Famitsu: For this issue's cover art, Morii suggested putting Famitsu's title in a shared speech bubble for Ishtar and Ereshkigal.

Takeuchi: Yeah, it's not unusual for Morii's ideas to have no precedent. But I feel trying to humor them is a test to our discipline. I take my hat off to his imaginativeness and the persistence it takes to see it all realized.

Famitsu: It must be a blessing to see that Morii is not the only one with enough passion to put all the pieces in place.

Takeuchi: I am very grateful for it. Every idea is taxing on the artist in the sense that it increases the amount of pictures to make. But lately, most artists provide us with theirs of their own initiative. Noble Phantasm cut-ins, for example, take a lot of time because they need to be split into multiple parts and animated. But it's generally agreed they're a nice flourish, so an increasing number of artists came forward willing to do it. I can't thank them enough. It's tangible that our options of presentation are expanding, and I think the players are happy for it. There are some displays of enthusiasm and absurd resources that are only possible to include in games where everything, including the battle characters, is 2D. I believe FGO has weapons a 3D game can't use, and we'll continue to leverage them.

Famitsu: Lastly, tell us what exciting news should we be expecting for the 10th year.

Takeuchi: Until very recently, I didn't pay much attention to the fact that the 10th anniversary was coming, but now it's finally coming to me that it's already the next year. With this being a live service game, I believe it's easier to set a goal for how many years it'll go on for. But everyone in FGO's team, without exception, is aiming to conclude the story. How many years that would take is secondary to that, therefore I take the fact that it took 10 years as an unintended consequence. That said, I believe the fans who supported us for this long deserve that we make an unforgettable 10th anniversary both in-game and outside. We'll continue to build up hype for the finale, **and that will be the greatest challenge we've ever faced. I hope to have your continued support and positive expectations.**

Famitsu: By the way, are we going to have an 11th Anniversary?

Takeuchi: Without a doubt. But don't forget that the finale is the goal that our little story has been working towards. The players will get to choose when exactly they'll tackle the finale, but wish they all get to experience the battle and adventure together at the earliest opportunity.
