**# Nasu and Takeuchi's 8th Anniversary interview**
**---  **

## Part 1 (on Arcueid, Holmes, and Tezcatlipoca)
  
**I was surprised to see Archetype:Earth's sudden appearance on last year's 7th Anniversary. Before anything, can you tell us the story behind her implementation?**

Nasu: After releasing Tsukihime-a piece of blue glass moon-, I wished to put Arcueid in the game as soon as possible. But releasing her wasn't easy because I couldn't find any place to insert her into the main story. Upon giving up on that idea, I thought maybe could release her to celebrate the 7th anniversary, and that should be fine as long as her playable name was Archetype:Earth.

Takeuchi: We knew the fans were waiting for it, so we were discussing if this was the year to do the Tsukihime collab. However, Nasu proposed it'd be more fun to release her in a different form, and that's how we got to Archetype:Earth. It caused a huge buzz in the room, with everyone amazed at the absurdities that come out of his mouth.

Nasu: I couldn't accept a TsukiRe collab without the Far Side in it, not to mention making a collab would require also introducing Shiki, Ciel, and Akiha, plus some other characters. After much deliberation, we decided on releasing only Arcueid as the 7th Anniversary celebration. The moments before the announcement got me half-dizzy. It was a huge relief to see the audience receive it well.

**One of Arcueid's abilities in TsukiRe is to confiscate Textures. Is this in any way related to the bleaching of Earth?**

Nasu: Speaking in terms of the development order, Arcuied's came first. When I began designing the bleached Earth, TsukiRe's development was close to completion, so when Takeuchi asked what exactly the bleached Earth was like, I answered him "Same thing as Luminary Arc". From there, Takeuchi produced a white image full of trails, and I said "Let's go with this visual". That's all, they have no correlation in-story.

**Arcueid's appearance gets me expecting another heroine.**

Nasu: Yes, this always got me thinking about how we can't have Heroine A without Heroine B. But I also can't just introduce her to the game willy-nilly. I want to find the most interesting form to deliver her as... Good luck, future Kinoko.

**Back to the topic of Archetype:Earth, did you have any major difficulty with her 3 Ascensions?**

Takeuchi: The hardest one was Archetype in the 1st Ascension. Her dress stands out enough in Tsukihime but is on the subdued side for FGO standards. I did all I could to change the design in a way that delivered Archetype's flashiness, but when I was done, she didn't look like Archetype. So what I did is that I took the base Archetype silhouette and added minor detail upon minor detail to display her fanciness.

Nasu: No surprise, but my favorite is the 2nd stage. When he first showed me her art, I imagined this is what Arc would look like 3 years after one specific route. I knew I could draw character from this idea, so I wrote her voice lines in one sitting. And the result was this ultra-happy Arcueid (laughs).

**Is the 3rd stage an Arcueid who never drank blood?**

Nasu: Yes. The idea is that this is what she'd probably turn out like if she stayed sheltered for 1000 years. It's a what-if scenario fine-tuned exclusively for FGO, and for that reason, it can be considered the purest Arcueid can be, depending on how you define the word.

**I'm also expecting Phantasmoon.**

Nasu: Oh, I want to release her. But that's one thing that really demands a Collab. That said, there's still a lot I need to do with FGO, so once that's all done and the dust is settled, I want to produce some kind of phantasmic carnival.

**In last year's interview, you mentioned that Sherlock Holmes's death scene was scheduled to happen in Lostbelt No. 7. What was the story going to be like back then?**

Nasu: The essential plans for the plot didn't really change, but we planned for him to accompany you to the conversation with Daybit, get his identity exposed, and be forced to fight. Think back to it now, that chapter would have been so overpacked, so I'm really glad we had Traum.

**You mean we'd have to fight Holmes no matter what?**

Nasu: Correct. That would be where his death scene would take place. But while we organized things, Young Moriarty came to life, and with him existing, Holmes's death scene could only be in Traum. Considering what his mission was about, his death scene could reasonably happen at any time after LB5 was over, so we kept rescheduling it according to the story's necessities. If what you want to know is who got the biggest changes from the general part 2 plans, that'd be Tezcatlipoca. He wasn't supposed to be that big of a deal.

**It's hard to imagine Tezcatlipoca not being that big of a deal at first.**

Nasu: Back then, his part would be about as major as Camazotz. A powerful enemy but not the one carrying the overall themes of LB7. In 2021, when I was deciding things for the more detailed plot plan for LB7, I studied about Latin America, and upon reaching a greater understanding of what kind of god Tezcatlipoca was, I knew that he transcended morality. Also, Tajima Shou's great design was another major factor. It's what you get when that's what I was looking at while writing (laughs).

**Can you tells how you managed to hire Mr. Tajima?**

Takeuchi: Tajima-sensei is a living legend for authors of our generation, naturally a mangaka I held a lot of respect for. And by happenstance, I had a chance to have a lunch with him, where he very casually slipped a "If you have any work for me, I'm here for it". And thanks to this moment of bonding, he contributed to Trails of 15 Years of Fate/stay night - Type-Moon Museum Exhibit with his illustration of Gilgamesh.

**And you got his contacts later?**

Takeuchi: Tajima-sensei's manager sent me a formal request to work with him again. It happened exactly when we were debating what to do about Tezcatlipoca, so I asked Nasu if he would be a good fit for it.

Nasu: When I heard the story, I thought we really would need a living legend like Tajima Shou to come to grips with Tezcatlipoca's personhood. I only told him my design ideas once and he just keep sending one sick draft after the other.

**Was he always going to have a modern design?**

Takeuchi: Nasu had a clear image in his head, and knowing Tajima-sensei would be the one putting it on paper, I already had a pretty decent idea of what the final form would look like. The first stage was done by making a long series of minor corrections on the first finished art.

Nasu: Tezcatlipoca is a material man, so I thought he needed a few accessories. Then for the Jaguar Suit in the 2nd stage, I told him to imagine an undecorated diver suit with minor sci-fi undertones. And then he delivered EXACTLY the image I had in my head.

Takeuchi: The third stage was left entirely at his discretion, all we told him was "Go bonkers, you can get as monstrous as you want with this one". And his answer was designing a skeleton mecha. The thing was obviously too big and weird to make a playable character out of, so we used that design as his Noble Phantasm and asked him to make a new 3rd stage.

Nasu: FGO characters tend to get more extravagant with each Ascension, and practically no SSR is at their simplest on the 3rd Ascension, but considering Tajima-sensei's nature as an artist and Tezcatlipoca's nature as a god, I thought that appearance was a valid idea. He's playing the modern man in the 1st stage, so I like the 3rd stage returning to the official Tezcatlipoca. But honestly, I was feeling kinda fearful about his reception. Thankfully, the player response as far as I hear is "I wasn't feeling it at first, but upon reading the story, I couldn't imagine him any other way".

Takeuchi: Mictlan is a world quite different from ours, and Tajima-sensei artstyle alone can express deviation from normality. If anyone told me that character came from a different world from the rest, I'd readily believe it. I'm glad the LB7 cast manage to carry its world.

**People online treat Tez like he's their cool bro.**

Nasu: He's generally a guy you can have fun with. His "Call that Tezcatlipoca's hot take on it" line is said in a very modern tone because he's running on the heat of excitement there, but I needed to explain that that was on purpose when I think one of the proofreaders pointed out he doesn't talk like that anywhere else. Tezcatlipoca is on the peak of hype from standing in front of ORT, and the straightlaced Izcalli next to him doesn't know how to react to that.

**That quote wasn't even a recurring thing and it still managed to go memetic.**

Nasu: Those kinds of lines you can naturally throw in a conversation have a big staying power, I think.

Takeuchi: It's really amazing how tuning with the art can make anything feel like a line he really would say. I once asked Nasu how he came up with those, and he answered "I keep looking at the art while writing the script and they naturally come out". I was once again impressed by his unique work methods.

Nasu: I intentionally gave Tezcatlipoca 2 thirds of the usual amount of voiced lines. I could get more expressiveness from longer deliveries, but he's probably a guy who prefers it short and snappy. This was a better fit for Tajima-sensei's solid artstyle, so it's the right way for FGO's Tezcatlipoca to be.

**Tezcatlipoca's Shadow Servant appeared Grand Berserker in the dream battle, but the Tezcatlipoca manifested in Chaldea was an Assassin. What's the meaning of this?**

Nasu: It was a hint that Tezcatlipoca was originally Grand Berserker. There was no one to replace the First Hassan after he vacated his crown, so he saw he'd have be the next one and became Assassin. Tezcatlipoca has a straightlaced side to him. If someone else will do it, it's not his problem, but if he's the only one, he'll take the job much to his chagrin, pretty much.

**Then one currently in Chaldea is Grand Assassin Tezcatlipoca?**

Nasu: Correct. Divine Spirits can't be Grands, but in Tezcatlipoca's case, it's because his base is a human body.

**Speaking of Tezcatlipoca, I was sure Meuniere died. How did he survive?**

Nasu: Uh, can bullets slip through the gap between the two halves of the brain? (laughs) Jokes aside, the bullet did pierce part of Meuniere's brain, but with a Magic Crest, that's still survivable. That said, he would never wake up. He was at a state where he was only barely able to return to the living because the underworld is a place were the definitions of dead and alive are looser and he had an amazing shaman treating him. Meaning he wouldn't be back without Kotomine.

**I vaguely remember Kotomine saying he wasn't helpful.**

Nasu: If you pay attention, you'll see he wasn't saying he failed. It was just the usual Kotomine joke, the "What a shame... (that this didn't leave a scar)".

## Part 2 (on U-Olga, Daybit, and ORT)

**I was quite surprised that U-Olga Marie travels with the protagonists in LB7. Was this twist planned from the start?**

Nasu: Traveling with U-Olga Marie before the endgame was always the plan. However, with how big Tezcatlipoca's presence became, the chapter would get immensely longer than intended if I portrayed Olga Marie as planned. My attempts to solve the problem fixed nothing, and that's how we got a two-parter (laughs).

**That's why...**

Nasu: Olga Marie's appearance as the President of Earth in Olympus being borderline comedy was a preparatory step for LB7. She's a threat but there's something fundamentally off about her. A being on a much grander scale but sorta like a lower-middle-class citizen. And an amazing person who acts mainly on the goodness of her heart.

**I didn't see that conclusion coming for her.**

Nasu: Understandable... What a shame, after I raised her into such a charming woman... After I had to restrain myself behind closed doors during Olympus's production because when Takeuchi sent me the President of Earth's design, I wanted to show everyone how cute she was as soon as possible... To think we'll never hear the President's speeches again...

**Why are you smiling about it? (laughs) But you could control U-Olga Marie in battles. Is there any plan to make her playable?**

Nasu: No, that one was made as an LB7-exclusive character. It's because of this exclusivity that the gameplay side allowed her to have those AoE attacks that Servants don't have. Having or not having this kind of surprise makes a huge difference for immersion. Also, because the opponents appearing in LB7 are lore-wise invincible, U-Olga Marie's ability to distribute Invul Pierce to everyone is the backup you need before you can even think about fighting the way you want. There are some scenes where you're screwed if you don't put U-Olga Marie in your party, but if you're paying attention to the story, you'll know when.

**She wanted to absorb ORT. Would she succeed if she was in perfect health?**

Nasu: In a 1-v-1 situation, with no outside interference, she would. I mean, she's our Earth Silhouette, you know?

**That's amazing. U-Olga Marie is the cover character for Soundtrack VI, in a profound illustration of her surrounded by celestial globes. Really memorable piece. What was the concept for that?**

Takeuchi: She's enclosed by globes because she's the President of Earth. It's meant to be an image of U-Olga Marie in a nursery, but it includes the most recurring themes of the game. That said, it doesn't contain any blatant meaning like everyone was expecting it to.

**The next questions will be about Daybit. Ever since his conversation with Peperoncino, I got the impression that he could see the future. Does he have any ability like that?**

Nasu: All he has is incredible perceptiveness. Because he spent years choosing only 5 minutes of each day to preserve, he can evaluate and estimate the future to some extent. He went to see Peperoncino in LB4 because his estimations predicted that he would throw away his life for someone else's sake later, so he wanted to say goodbye while he was still alive.

**He can choose what 5 minutes he keeps?**

Nasu: At the end of each day, he can choose what to keep. He's not making take-or-throw decisions in real-time. No, he can choose 5 minutes and then has to cut off the remaining 23 hours and 55 minutes. Which option would have been harsher is up to your opinion.

**Speaking of his 5 minutes, is what he said about having spared less than one day's worth of time for Ophelia something we're supposed to interpret in LB7 terms?**

Nasu: LB2 makes you think he's a cold-hearted guy, but when you get to know Daybit, you see that he really loved his friends. That line is not about the time passed in part 2, it's about his time in Chaldea, which means he cared about his team since all the way back then.

**Is it because Daybit cared about the team that Kadoc is still alive?**

Nasu: No, it's because Daybit didn't have any reason to kill Kadoc. If Kadoc had attacked him, things would have been different.

**But Daybit did say "I minced up Kadoc's team" to the protagonist.**

Nasu: He was trying to rile the protagonist up. The message he was trying to communicate is "Seriously try to kill me". Nonetheless, Daybit genuinely assumed Kadoc had no chance of surviving after the Angelic Artifact walled him in. His coming out alive was beyond his expectations.

**Tezcatlipoca tells that Daybit liked movies. What was his favorite genre?**

Nasu: The American movies he watched with his father. Like those heavy Clint Eastwood stories, for example. His father also made him watch some movies for children, but they generally watched what the father wanted to watch.

**Can you tell us why that ORT, who before only existed as a profile and pictures, would make his genuine appearance in FGO's main story?**

Nasu: Because there wasn't anywhere else to release him. If I released him in the context of Tsukihime, the game would become not what people want out of Tsukihime, and FGO was a perfect place to release him since it's a travel across the ends of many timelines. Making you fight a subspecies of ORT at the end of LB7 has been the plan from the start.

**Are you saying the whole thing started from the idea of fighting ORT?**

Nasu: I believed that if I could portray the ORT battle right, that was all LB7 needed. But the more I studied Latin America, the more I liked it. Ultimately, my thought experiment became "What if I mixed Type-Moon's pre-established sci-fi-esque depiction of Latin America with accurate Latin American culture, included the deinos mankind and the extraterrestrial Malla, and let it go on for 66 million years?".

**How was ORT's appearance designed?**

Nasu: We told PFALZ that he was a flying saucer creature 17 years ago, but neglected to say the flying saucer was the main body, causing him to mistakingly assume the spider was the main part... Sorry! I had to explain to him after all these years that the spider was like those bits of skin that peel off when you get sunburnt (laughs).

Takeuchi: I was so sure we'd go with the ORT images we originally had, but then Nasu proposed to renew his design. From there we settled on the technical specifications and made the request to PFALZ, and through many conversations about the transforming parts and whatnot, we got to that form.

**The protagonist's portrait gradually changes throughout the ORT fight. How many variations did you make?**

Takeuchi: Four.

Nasu: It was absolutely necessary, so I made Takeuchi take extra time out of his full schedule to draw them. I didn't want that effect to be just text lines of everyone saying "Your face looks horrible". That fight put everyone at their limits, so expressing concern for a single person wouldn't feel believable. I wanted every player who overcame LB7 to feel the "It's harrowing but I have to do it" in real-time.

Takeuchi: There was actually a plan to include one more, the most wrecked of them all, at the end. But that wouldn't make the players feel any better, so Nasu said he wanted one that still looked strong despite being past the peak of fatigue, and that last one was fixed into the 4th portrait.

**They look like they're already in a trance in the 4th picture.**

Nasu: Gotta have at least that much when you're using every Servant in the final battle against the strongest creature in outer space. We already decided in advance that no future battle will surpass the size and intensity of this one. The image represents the protagonist's strong will to get the deed done despite how much it really sucks to be physically and mentally worn out and have to sacrifice Heroic Spirits.

**And after the battle was over, we were introduced to Ort Xibalba, the humanoid form.**

Nasu: ...Believe it or not, this Heroic Spirit form, Ort Xibalba, wasn't a thing in the finalized plot plan. It just naturally turned out like that while I was writing the finale's script. It was a last-minute decision to use one of the human-shaped ideas from PFALZ's drafts.

**So there was a prototype for the humanoid form?**

Nasu: ORT will unfailingly use any means available to survive. He's a like a machine that keeps choosing for as long as options exist. Therefore, if taking a humanoid form is what will get him to keep going, he would do it. So that's why he pulled off the most absurd of his absurdities: unlawfully copying human history, simulating 140 million years, creating a timeline where he becomes a Heroic Spirit, then summoning himself from there.

Takeuchi: We made the spider form A, then the spider form B for after A was dealt with, then when we thought the UFO form would be the last... there comes Nasu blurting out "Next is Xibalba" (laughs). He was one of the first things we touched on because we knew he'd be the greatest climax, but even then, ORT never stopped attacking the game developers too.

**So the devs also had to throw the entire roster at ORT. Another big shock was seeing Ort Xibalba appear as the Grand Foreigner.**

Nasu: If every Class had a Grand, the Foreigner's Grand simply couldn't be anyone other than ORT, I thought... Sorry, Abby and Kukulcan...

**Did you always have a laid-out scheme on how to defeat ORT?**

Nasu: I did. After how much he's played up, I believe it was unconvincing for a human to defeat ORT, so upon thinking about how to beat him, my conclusion is that only ORT could do it.

**I couldn't imagine how you could defeat a being described in RPG terms as "the secret boss stronger than the final boss", but seeing that, it made a lot of sense to me.**

Nasu: Monsters are monsters because humans can't beat them. That thought begs the question: "What about Camazotz, who defeated ORT once?", but well, he's just a tremendous guy (laughs).

**I'm curious to know how he did it.**

Nasu: It was just a simple physical rushdown after every citizen and Natural Spirit invested their powers into giving him an unperishable body. The basic idea to keep attacking forever because they had no means to defeat him on a permanent basis. Camazotz favored spears, so his final move was a focused stab to the core at the center of the UFO, done through full-power flight. He was almost erased in the process, with his legs, torso, and head pulverized, but only the right hand gripping the spear survived, thus ORT's flying saucer fell to the Xibalba ground. I requested his "One point, focus only on one point!" voice line in his boss battle to be a recreation of that. ORT's coffin was made from the craters of Camazotz's spear attacks. That was where ORT's carcass dropped, so the coffin interior that the player sees once used to be ORT's crust.

**That was an amazing story.**

Nasu: Camazotz's spear and the right arm gripping it were left behind in Xibalba. Camazotz can't die, so he eventually regenerated from the arm, but in the time it took until he did, Malla collected the heart that Camazotz gouged off with his final will and made it the source of the sun. That's the general sequence of events.

**By the way, one deinos killed ORT once. Who was it?**

Nasu: Tepeu. After a dying Vucub lifted him to the sky, he shaved one life off while he glided past him, but the price he had to pay for it was ORT eating half his body. I thought this wouldn't be a nice CG to put on screen, so we decided to show that through prose only.

**The narration worded it as "One fell streaking across the sky like a lightning bolt" so I sorta assumed that was about Vucub.**

Nasu: Remember Tepeu can glide. That plus his Pan-Human magecraft allows him to, woooosh, maneuver mid-air like a bolt of lightning.

Takeuchi: You can also tell by listening to the sound effect in the gauge break.

Nasu: It's the sound effect from when the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception activate in Melty Blood: Type Lumina. That's a completely unimportant detail no one needed to know about, but the people who noticed it on the spot terrify me (laughs).

## Part 3 (on Ordeal Call and future content)

**The next questions will be about OC1. OC1: World within the Imaginary Number Compass, PAPERMOON was a chapter that mixed the essences of many past installments such as Fate/stay night and Fate/Zero.**

Nasu: Yes, that's what the chapter's writer wanted to do. Like with EoR, the OC writers get a premise but are encouraged to go all out on the idiosyncracies of their writing styles. I requested each of them to put in enough passion to make this their new representative work.

**Even the roles of each character feel traced from previous installments.**

Nasu: Because the story is about a world within a simulator, I believe what he was trying to portray was a meta take on what would happen if Holy Grail Wars of certain places and times were replicated. Rani even mentioned she was using real Holy Grail Wars as reference samples.

**Could Rani save the world if her plan was executed successfully?**

Nasu: Having more forces would make the fights easier, but I don't know if they could deal any damage to the final boss. Making more Alteregos wouldn't help since they would ultimately saturate and get worse each time.

**One major point of OC1 for me was the introduction of the Rani Series.**

Takeuchi: Rani XII aside, all members of the Rani Series were designed by Lasengle staff. We got many different artists to make NPCs for OC1 with quite a lot of enthusiasm, so please give them the attention they deserve.

Nasu: He initially said he wanted to go with the Sakura Series, but adding CCC elements to an already packed mix would make the story a mess. Then his next idea was the Mash Series.

**Using Mash would have been more shocking.**

Nasu: Oh, it would. And it would ruin her character's integrity. After this suggestion, I had a talk with the writer and advised him that using Rani would be the best, if not the only, option. And that's how we began mass-producing the Rani Series.

Takeuchi: The writer's demand for the Rani Series design was that each of them was requested to a different artist to make them more unique. I really didn't know what to do about that, but luckily enough, Lasengle happened to be hiring new staff back then and most of them knew how to draw. Talk about perfect timing.

Nasu: The result was them creating with a lot of love because they were excited to see their characters on the screen. Every Rani was wonderfully cute. And later the writer was put on time out for causing that much trouble to the team.

Takeuchi: But that was one more thing that helped spice up the new main story chapter in a way that looks very different from LB7. Although my personal favorites were Hotosouka's Sakura and Medusa (laughs).

**I never thought I'd see a 5* Medusa.**

Nasu: I always said I wanted to make at least one 5* Medusa before FGO was over. It was an unrealistic expectation considering Takeuchi's schedule, but I thought that for the Saber Class, we could ask someone else. Then I asked the chapter writer to come up with a basic concept for her and Takeuchi chose the illustrator.

Takeuchi: We were initially expecting her to be 4*, but the illustration Hotosouka delivered was so good that it breathed life into a 5* Medusa.

**Make a Summer Medusa one day.**

Nasu: Huh? (laughs)

Takeuchi: We'll think about it.

**OC1 also introduced new sprites for a Chaldea staff member. It is possible we'll get more staff sprites later?**

Nasu: That was a special case because it was relevant to the story. Don't expect it to become a regular thing.

**Give us a progress update on OC2, if that's allowed.**

Nasu: The writer is working at a steady pace. Wait for it.

**One of the words in the teaser PV was "Tokyo", and the setting seems to be Tokyo as well, but that doesn't mean we're coming back to Shinjuku, does it?**

Nasu: It's not Shinjuku. I believe the setting will come with many surprises, with the expected reaction being "Ok, that's technically Tokyo". It's looking like the next writer will also cause trouble by being unwilling to compromise on a lot of details... Good luck, people of Lasangle!

**In the PV, you can see part of a fourth Class Card on the screen for a fraction of a second, so would it be correct to believe that there will be 4 OCs in total?**

Nasu: As everyone already predicted, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when. Look forward to the surprising timing of it. In our long years working with FGO, we've been introducing Classes outside the standard Holy Grail War roster with no explanation. Before the game is over, we need to clarify each Class's significance and the reason why they're allowed. It's partly our responsibility for creating each Class.

**And OC is there to portray that?**

Nasu: Yes. I initially wanted to explain all Classes at once, but that idea was too incohesive. The direction we decided on from there was to split it into one story per Class and start expanding the OC plot starting in 2023. If you play PAPERMOON, aside from getting a good FGO chapter, you'll also be able to understand what our farewells to each Class will be like.

**Are you going to make stories for all Extra Classes? Mooncancer included?**

Nasu: No, Mooncancers are like the EX Rank or the fun bonus pages at the end of a manga volume, and more accurately, they have extraterritorial rights by default (laughs). Pretenders don't cause distortions because they come disguised as existing Classes. And we can't make a whole story for Shielder because there's only one of them, so our plan for this one is to do the thing everyone has been waiting for. Look forward to it.

**I was shocked to see Sodom's Beast/Draco join the party still on her Beast Class immediately after we were told we'd correct the distortions caused by our misuse of Extra Classes.**

Nasu: Yeah, that's FGO for you. No brakes on this train!

Takeuchi: We were just as shocked when they said Draco would be a playable Beast.

Nasu: It's been long enough for at least one Beast to be acceptable. Beasts do whatever they want. And that Class Card is exclusive to Draco. Oh, but you know about one Mooncancer who also had an exclusive Card and things didn't end up well for her (laughs).

**Then could we perhaps have other Beasts?**

Nasu: Probably not. As far as Pan-Human History goes, she's the only Beast that can reach a neutral state.

Takeuchi: Are you sure it's a good idea to say that on record?

Nasu: It's the truth. And made sure to include the important keyword in the sentence.

**Can you tell us more about the yearly summer event?**

Nasu: If you look at the picture of Morgan and Arthuria Caster on the cover of this magazine, you can imagine who will be the featured Servants.

Takeuchi: This year's summer was written with the full power of Nasu Kinoko, so keep your expectations high.

**What was the concept for the Morgan and Arthuria Caster outfits on the cover?**

Takeuchi: I believe the first idea to come to anyone's mind for Summer Morgan is a black swimsuit. I, however, wanted something lighter to reflect the idea that she's here on vacation. Among the many ideas I drafted, I thought white and gold would look fine and refreshing on her, and from there I aimed for a slightly fancy half-dress-half-swimsuit outfit.

Nasu: It was smooth sailing with Morgan but Arthuria Caster had her stormy passages.

Takeuchi: We wanted her to feel like a swimsuit character but couldn't make her too cute, so I put out a lot of different options. Ultimately, we went with a school uniform-like design with street fashion elements. And, while preserving this summery and lively impression plus Arthuria Caster's personality, I included a lot of jokes and references in the 2nd and 3rd stages.

**The last question will be about Fate/Samurai Remnant. Miyamoto Musashi appears in the game, but Musashi was erased from the Throne of Heroes in FGO, wasn't she?**

Nasu: The story is chronologically before Olympus. It portrays a possible Musashi from after the end of EoR but before going to the Lostbelts.

**Musashi pretended to be Iori in FGO's Swordbeauties event. Was that foreshadowing?**

Nasu: Yes. We already had the project concept in 2019, so we released a story that said Iori was Musashi's disciple.

Takeuchi: Iori rocks. No protagonist before surmounted as many uphill battles against Servants as he did, and I think that's very sexy of him.

Nasu: I love his dead fish eyes. Look forward to a brand new Fate/ experience.

**Now tell us about your prospects and enthusiasm for the 9th year of FGO.**

Takeuchi: As it became obvious enough, especially with LB7, production costs are constantly increasing. The cause for this is a workplace where people are constantly wanting to try new things, and this year's summer event will deliver more proof of this. The development team is doing our collective best to dash through the newly started Ordeal Call in order to reach the climax of our real objective: the true finale. We're counting on your support.

Nasu: You know how at the end of LB7, when ORT reached the sun, you look back and see it was all crystal behind you? I'll never forget the despair on Lasengle's faces when they initially said "Only the tracks of his movement become crystal, right?" and I answered, "No, it's going to spread in real-time like a world tree and in the end, all of Mictlan will be crystal".

**I can imagine the scene.**

Nasu: When playing Mictlan on my own device, I got teared up at the end when I stopped to look at the map and it was that gorgeous crystal hell everywhere. After 20 years, I finally did it, I'm finally done with ORT. I continue to make my dreams come true and I couldn't be more grateful for it. There is still a lot more plot to go and I'd appreciate it if you stuck with me for it.
