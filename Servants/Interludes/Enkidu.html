okay.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Fou!?</p><p><strong>Fou:</strong><br> Fou? Fou!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You seem to have awoken from REM sleep...and now, good morning.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I was worried for a moment that your mind might have drifted off somewhere else again.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If you are still sleepy,<br> please have some coffee at the cafeteria.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve recently started receiving supplies from the outside world, so there may have been some quality coffee in the shipment.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hahaha. Sorry to inform you, but I have a jack.<br> That&#39;s four of a kind.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Oh, how wonderful! They all match!<br> I have four queen cards!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> A card that represents a sovereign...four kings.<br> Does this mean that I have four of a kind?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Wait just a moment? Are the two of you cheating?<br> Honestly? So I was the only one who tampered with the cards?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my, oh my!?<br> Have I been left out?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, how disappointing that I was unable to be one of the possessors of FOUR of something! That number represents death in many Asian cultures!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> As you can all see, I have five jokers!<br> I have won the battle but lost the war!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see...so five of a kind is possible...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Of course not!<br> Having FIVE jokers isn&#39;t even a viable way to cheat!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> At best, Mephy&#39;s crime is absurd! Knowing as he did that his skulduggery would not pass ANYONE&#39;S scrutiny, he STILL undertook it!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heha! Your words of praise slay me! Would you like a little clock as a token of my appreciation?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Absolutely not! I will have no part in your scheme of blowing me up to dispose of evidence of your cheating!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s with this weird combination of people?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You&#39;re right...it is strange to see these Servants together. Perhaps the Professor is scheming...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, now, young lady... Can you truly blame every strange thing that happens here on me?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I am not judging, of course. It is nice to be suspected of criminal activity. It is almost as if you trust me!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Looks fun! I wanna join! Party tiiime!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Kuhahaha!<br> It&#39;s wonderful to see you in high spirits, Master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Yes, please join in on the fun, Master!<br> The more the merrier for a tea party!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Then shall we resume our poker game?<br> Shall we wager our very souls? Yes, we shall!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I shall wager Faust&#39;s soul, so I suggest you match with the Spirit Origin of your most beloved Servant!</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What shall we do, Senpai?<br> I can&#39;t see it going well if we stay here long...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Just based on past experience...<br> I feel trouble on the way...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, my apologies if you are concerned.<br> I was actually the one who called them all over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> You, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You seem surprised.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, well...I&#39;m sorry.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Setting Nursery aside, it&#39;s a bit of a surprise you&#39;d call the other two here...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You would put me in the same category as Mephy?<br> I believe I may cry...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Please do! Come now, cry your heart out!<br> I am eager for the sidesplitting laughter that will merit!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Then laugh! Laugh until your sides rip open and your vitals spill out! Now, do hurry and explain yourself.<br> We are getting nowhere as we are going now, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. While Mephistopheles&#39;s whims are certainly amusing, I suppose this is not a particularly efficient way to operate...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I must admit...I have been interested in these people since the moment I was summoned here. I&#39;ve been wanting to speak to them for some time.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There are, of course, others in whom I am interested,<br> but these are the only ones who were available now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Interested...?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Surprised?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I assumed Enkidu liked to be alone.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. I do not mind being alone.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But were I to simply remain alone until I expire, there would have been no point in my being reconstructed here in the first place.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I have to admit, this IS an interesting group.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It is. Everyone here in Chaldea–the Heroic Spirits, mages, and even the staff–are all very...unique.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That is why I must study everyone here.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> In order to optimize my systems in a place like this, it is sometimes necessary to become actively involved with others.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Optimizing...your systems?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. I have been shaped to work here as ideally as possible. That is why I was created.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What does that actually mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Please continue while we play poker...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah!? Master! We&#39;ve received an urgent message from the Command Room!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey, Fujimaru. Sorry for interrupting you right when you were about to go eat.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We&#39;ve gotten some strange readings from an area in a Singularity we already corrected.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hm? Is Enkidu with you, too?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, that&#39;s handy.<br> Can you all come here?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, hey. Is this the first time I&#39;ve called Enkidu up here?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That you&#39;ve asked me here means we are dealing with THAT Singularity, correct?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly. Sensing–Well, having the capacity to accurately assess a situation is a sign that you are indeed a well-functioning machine.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We picked up these strange readings in ancient Babylonia, east of Uruk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You know Ishtar&#39;s temple atop Mt. Ebih?<br> It&#39;s somewhere in the forest near that valley.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Hm? What is it?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Uh, well...is everything all right?<br> You just looked really grim there...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, my apologies.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that I heard a term that could cause a cascading system crash...a word that my systems prioritize for immediate deletion.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course it is.<br> After all, the Enkidu of myth was...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, well.<br> No need to get into anything like that right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Our readings are strange...a pattern we&#39;ve never seen before, and we can&#39;t pinpoint the exact location.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I want to ask Enkidu, who possesses Presence Detection and is familiar with the area, to guide you. Would that be all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That would be great!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you. I am not sure how much help I will be,<br> but please use my skills as you see fit.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m getting a sense of déjà vu...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Remember, Senpai?<br> That wasn&#39;t actually Enkidu back then.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ... Actually, that may not be necessarily true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now that it&#39;s been decided, let&#39;s head out.<br> If something has gone awry, we must fix it quickly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Right.<br> Are you ready, Fujimaru?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready as ever.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll let you know once we know what we&#39;re dealing with.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Rayshift successful. At least this time you ended up on solid ground, Senpai! Any problems, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No, we&#39;re all right.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...This breeze brings back memories.<br> The color of the sky hasn&#39;t changed either.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Yes. I see that wistful gaze on Master&#39;s face as [♂ he /♀️ she} gazes skyward... Perhaps Master was expecting yet another free fall?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> !? M-Mephistopheles!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hm. Falling from the sky, hm?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This is exactly the sort of place a shady man like myself can shine!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> In any story where someone falls from the sky, the most important detail would be WHO does the rescuing. Master, you must choose carefully.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heh...hehehe...!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Rest assured, Ms. Mash!<br> As you can see, Master has arrived unscathed!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> If there is a problem at all...it would be that WE have accompanied Master! Heeheehee!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Professor and Nursery...why are you there!?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;ve been examining the Rayshift system rather thoroughly, so it was no trouble sneaking the three of us along for the ride, as it were.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That is its own set of problems,<br> but Mash is asking why you three are here at all.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Simple, really. I was curious why Enkidu had wished to speak to us all. Of course, I am also quite curious about Enkidu as well.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> There is much that cannot be learned merely from a few games of poker. Oh, I can figure anything out, as I am a genius!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But if we are to grant Enkidu&#39;s wish, I decided an adventure together would be an amusing way to do so.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I see. Makes sense.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, please be careful not to fall for what he says! The Professor can be very reckless as long as he gets his point across.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Another one of his schemes... Is it planned or made up on the spot?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah, but my little scheme is successful the moment it confuses! The secret to a graceful equation or formula is in how much of your inspiration you can work in.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well this will certainly be a lively journey. In my time, it was customary to travel in pairs, so this is new to me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I hear that Babylonia is the place where the first stories were told!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I can&#39;t wait to meet all the people who were characters in so many stories from this nation!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my, oh my!<br> Everyone seems to be in such high spirits!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> You know they say no journey is long with good company...as long as that company screams in agony! And so I will accompany you on your journey to the afterlife as best I am able!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh my. It seems there is quite the mixture of good and bad in this party!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> At any rate, let us head out in search of this strange rift!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I can detect something within the forest, but combing through every inch of it would be...irritating.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Enkidu, do you sense anything with your Presence Detection skill?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...What a strange sensation.<br> It&#39;s like the entire forest–No, this is...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It appears we have been detected.<br> Perhaps...my presence lured them to us.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What are you talking about?<br> We&#39;re not detecting any...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, wait... I am detecting something.<br> Enkidu&#39;s detection ability is really something.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But this is–No, impossible!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> H-how? Why are THEY there...?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I have a bad feeling about this. It seems we are being approached by something that should not be here...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At your four o&#39;clock!<br> Be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong></p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Laḫmu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Why!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s not possible! The Laḫmu should&#39;ve all disappeared along with the Chaos Tide the moment we defeated Tiamat!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh? Something that should be dead appears right before us!? How peculiar! Well how is that different from us, since we just popped out of nowhere!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Are THESE beings someone&#39;s hero? Are WE the rift in this Singularity that must be corrected!?</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> nz:qc@！　:t@;q@！　:t@;qzaq@！</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> aihをslb/！　c4r;f@hxlをb0p.！<br> 0qdqaf　t3xyf　te-4x;.！</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;re seeing a rapidly increasing number of Laḫmu in the forest! They&#39;re trying to surround Enkidu!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Be careful!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are the Laḫmu mistaking Enkidu for Kingu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see...so they&#39;re the ones.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I can at least pretend to understand your irritation and ideals.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But I cannot allow you to endanger the work that has been done. I hope you will understand.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> b\p！　vgx:！　hoezhp！<br> 3khxl！　:t@;qhxl！　u2@lhq@:！</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Your reasons for wanting to kill me are legitimate, but you must know that I will respond with all due force.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Laḫmu are on the move!<br> Senpai, please be careful!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Not detecting any other Laḫmu in your area. It looks like those that had been headed your way are retreating back into the forest.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> My, oh, my. The sight of those things leaves quite the impression on one&#39;s memory. I would not be surprised if a normal person went insane upon seeing them!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> They were a little different than Jabberwocks...<br> I wonder what story those monsters came from...?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh? And here I thought those creatures bore quite the resemblance to Enkidu here...or are you saying that I am in dire need of glasses?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hmmm, looks like those creatures weren&#39;t the cause of the rift.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I had an eye on the readings during the battle,<br> and it looks like the rift is what&#39;s creating them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I hate to even say it, but it&#39;s possible that there&#39;s something like a remnant of Tiamat in the forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What!?<br> Does that mean Tiamat might come back again?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think that&#39;s very likely.<br> After all, gradual as it may be, the reading is dissipating.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even if we left it alone, there&#39;s a chance that whatever the issue is might be corrected in the Restoration of Humanity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Were I some manner of living residue of a Demon God Pillar, or harbored enough malice, I would gladly offer myself up to be reused. Not a bad deal for debris.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well, pretty much.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can&#39;t leave it alone.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Knew you&#39;d say that.<br> Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll back you up.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;d like my overtime pay in Fool&#39;s Chains, please.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hah! If we had any in storage, we&#39;d have used them already. Honestly, maybe you could actually go out and collect some to supply Chaldea, hmm?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> (If I can&#39;t even pinpoint its exact location,<br> that must mean... Yes, that&#39;s right...)</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> (The time to integrate the system may have come...<br> I never imagined that I might be upgraded after becoming a Heroic Spirit...)</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is everything all right, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes...I was just reminiscing about my journeys in the past.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My only wish is that this journey with you would be as pleasant and enjoyable as it was when I traveled with...him, Master.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Or perhaps...that one day you will become a hero just like him...</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ah, the air here brings back memories.<br> The wind, the soil...they haven&#39;t changed.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And the density of the magical energy here... Were it not for Chaldea&#39;s aid, any human from Master&#39;s time would not survive this.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m compelled to walk to the ends of the earth, but that is not the mission at hand for me at this moment.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True... It&#39;d be a bit of a pain for us if you just wandered off to the edge of the Singularity now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Who&#39;s to say your presence wouldn&#39;t give the world a conniption and create a whole new Singularity?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Haha, you think too highly of me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> A doll like myself cannot make the world do anything. Changing the stars is beyond even the gods.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The world yields only to the command of the true king born beneath the stars.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However roundabout your means of doing so may be, spare us the boasts about your friend. Our current goal is to find whoever is controlling the Laḫmu.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, as even your Presence Detection doesn&#39;t seem to be effective here, we may indeed need to comb through the forest inch by inch.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But wouldn&#39;t you say it&#39;s elderly abuse to make a man my age walk through a forest the size of a small country?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles :</strong><br> Hahaha, hehehe! The solution is simple, old, aged man! We should burn the forest down so we can have a clear view from where we stand!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You may call me old, but do refrain from adding “aged” as well. You make my Spirit Origin sound like some manner of peculiar delicacy.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Burning down an entire forest is barbaric!<br> Let&#39;s ask Bunyan to help us pioneer the land peacefully!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ah, wonderful idea. Paul Bunyan is a Servant I would very much like to meet someday.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Her Spirit Origin composition is somewhat irregular, and I have been meaning to learn about her before she disappears like a dream.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um... Setting what Bunyan is like aside, cutting down a whole forest might just make things worse...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, wouldn&#39;t you be against deforestation or a large-scale fire, Enkidu?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I thought you were sort of a conservationist.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, of course. I love nature,<br> and I do believe it to be very important.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But to me, the development of a city, mining in the deep ocean, and all other such things that humans tend to do are also part of nature.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course, I would suggest caution should the development itself run sufficiently out of control as to threaten humanity&#39;s survival.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Should we burn down the forest?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai, drastically changing the environment like that will likely affect the Singularity as well.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. Let&#39;s put a pin in that for now. It can be a last resort. I don&#39;t see people of this time period liking us much if we destroy their resources.</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Anyway, carpet-bombing the area would be a touch...artless. I would prefer to formulate a different approach.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles :</strong><br> Oh my, oh my!? Perhaps the old, aged man would like to use his coffin to skate over the land or fly through the air to scout the forest end to end?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> As I have REPEATEDLY said, that skyward leap is not a typical thing for me! Think of the energy such a move demands! Honestly!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> ...Wait a minute. Thinking of typical approaches,<br> would Enkidu&#39;s abilities not be useful here?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You are right to point out that leaping and sprinting great distances are indeed capabilities I possess.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Normally, I would have the forest itself cooperate with me...but it appears that this land and my powers do not seem to be compatible to each other.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Compatible?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> To be specific, it is almost as if there is a curse that has been placed upon me, though I doubt it&#39;s related to the irregularity we&#39;re observing.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> In any case, so long as we can get rid of the source of the curse, I should be able to operate at full power.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Source?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think I&#39;m starting to get it...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Ah, speak of the devil.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> A familiar Spirit Origin appears to be heading in your direction. I&#39;m sure Enkidu has already detected it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes...true.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh? But this Spirit Origin reading is...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Master. I suggest you take three steps back.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well...according to my calculations, you should move within ten seconds. I also have a visual now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> D-did I do something to offend you!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The reverse may be a possibility, but there is no reason for me to hate you, Master. Don&#39;t worry.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But that is exactly why you need to step away from me.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> An attack!?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It&#39;s raining light! It looks like the sun is crying!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Suddenly, a mysterious rain of light attacked the expedition team!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles :</strong><br> Hee ha! I&#39;m ready to jump ahead of the expedition team to capture this moment on camera, Master!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Hmph. He is not taking this seriously at all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Amazing... Enkidu managed to deflect all of that inbound artillery!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> While I know Master was nearby, is this really all the power you will bring to bear in an attempt to kill me?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Or perhaps, without the other gods behind you,<br> you are just this pathetically weak?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Why the sudden cold, harsh voice, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Of course not. I&#39;d never go all-out just to smash a clay doll into a worthless pile of refuse!</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> That aside, I see that your magical energy is stable, thanks to Fujimaru. You should be grateful to that child.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Y-you are...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Honestly...what&#39;s the big idea in bringing that thing, Fujimaru?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Things were stabilizing here, all thanks to my protection! Were you trying to mess all that up!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ishtar!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. This is my land, so you should show some more respect by putting “the Great” in front of my name. You might get a blessing if you do.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This one aside, how&#39;s Ereshkigal doing?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I may have caused you all some trouble in the past, but isn&#39;t it a bit cruel for THAT to be the first thing that comes out of your mouth!?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Anyway. I don&#39;t have time to be dealing with you right now, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I need to smash that nasty eyesore into red clay and dump it into the river. It&#39;s ruining the whole aesthetic here.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Even though you made yourself look like Shamhat, the moment I know who you really are you just become hideous to me. You&#39;re the worst.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see. As you are the goddess of beauty, it is fitting that you at least appreciate Shamhat&#39;s beauty. That makes me happy. Goodbye.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t you change the subject while you attack me!<br> A clay doll like you shouldn&#39;t be able to move like some kind of martial arts master!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Amazing! It&#39;s like a rain of light between sky and land! So this is the story of “Enuma Elish”!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles :</strong><br> Oh my, even a single stray bullet could end Master&#39;s life here and now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> W-wait!<br> Please calm down, Ishtar!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s Enkidu!<br> It&#39;s not the version of Kingu we fought!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Come on now, Mash.<br> Who do you think I am?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I was perfectly aware that this was the real Enkidu, not Kingu, from the start!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If that&#39;s the case...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And THAT is what I&#39;m trying to kill right here, right now!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> B-but...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s not surprising.<br> Don&#39;t you remember their previous interaction, Mash?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Even the myth engraved on the clay tablets mentions that the two of them were on VERY unfriendly terms.<br> So it&#39;s no shock this is how a meeting would go.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> When we were hunting down Demon God Pillars, I let you off the hook because there were more important things, but now that you&#39;ve sashayed back into my turf...you&#39;ve got a death wish, right?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m perfectly happy to help you with that.<br> Be a good doll and just sit there to rot away in agony♡</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well, I&#39;m relieved to know you&#39;re still the vulgar fiend you&#39;ve always been. I will have no hesitation in disposing of you, even with Master here.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Your age is over. Humanity has already made their ties with a new god. Your attempt to cling to your rule makes you a malevolent god.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t give me that know-it-all crap! You don&#39;t belong with these humans, haven&#39;t you figured that out!?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Even though you&#39;re a good-for-nothing, you at least gained a true friend. But since you turned your back on the gods, there is nothing worthwhile in you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am a tool.<br> Protection and concern for the gods is wasted on me.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I see...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh, don&#39;t tell me... You&#39;re not still feeling guilty over what happened to that child, are you?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Now that I look closer, the Heroic Spirits you&#39;re traveling with...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I get it now.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Unbelievable. You say you&#39;re just a tool, but it looks like you&#39;re still hung up on that child&#39;s demise.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You really don&#39;t know when to hold your tongue. You&#39;re the absolute embodiment of an insolent god who&#39;s never doubted that everything is theirs.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey, you&#39;re finally getting serious.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The wounds and splendor engraved upon the planet...I shall sing upon it! Age of Babylon!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> A new Noble Phantasm revealed here, of all places!?</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Calm down. They do that all the time. It creates weapons from the ground, like spears and chains.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So that ability was a Noble Phantasm as well...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Fine. Any weapon a piece of junk like you makes could only be trash. I&#39;m going to show you the product of a true beauty!</p><p><strong>Demonic Statue:</strong><br> !</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whoa, those things...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> This...is the crystallization of beauty...?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I will refrain from comment... I do at least have some small sense of mercy in my program.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Really? I&#39;ll point out that I will show you no mercy.<br> You have two options: you can die, or you can die!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re about to get a taste of the awesome power that scarred Mt. Ebih!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Even the supreme god An once said only a fool would try to defy it!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Wasn&#39;t he saying that to you, Ishtar!?</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ouuuuch...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Hey! Fujimaru!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Why&#39;re you taking Enkidu&#39;s side here!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You struck first...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ugh... Okay, MAYBE that&#39;s true, but this is Enkidu!<br> Isn&#39;t humanity all about preemptive strikes?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah, so we have reached a point where gods use humanity as a justification for their behavior!<br> I&#39;d be curious to know what the other gods think of this!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Stop! I strongly urge you not to do that! I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll get SUPER complicated in A LOT of ways!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Couldn&#39;t help it after seeing the Demonic Statue&#39;s design...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Wouldn&#39;t that be more reason for you not to attack it!? What are you, a hornet that attacks anything that&#39;s a color you don&#39;t like?</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> But they were wonderful monsters! They would definitely be found in picture books as the bad guys!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have you know that they were supposed to be guardian statues of justice that received the blessing of a goddess...me!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Sigh) Fine.<br> I know this is no time for a battle to the death.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Right. The moment I tried to inflict the final blow,<br> I felt as if Master were about to cast Gandr on me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Master, trusting Ishtar is your choice, but I recommend extreme caution in dealing with such a wild, capricious goddess as her.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She may say that all she does is for humans, but her entire thought process is fundamentally different to begin with. What&#39;s worse, she is unaware of this.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Just think of her as one of those bizarre sorts who turn up at the change of seasons...someone with delusions of managing the world.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh really? You&#39;ve got a lot of nerve to say something like that♡</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> One of these days, when Fujimaru&#39;s not around...</p><p><strong>F：Ishtar:</strong><br> ...if we ever encounter each other somewhere Chaldea isn&#39;t involved, I&#39;m going to use all my godly power and smash you to tiny pieces♡</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Unfortunately for you, such a miracle is unlikely unless Chaldea or humanity is on the verge of catastrophe.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Hee-haw! Is this what they call a Chekov&#39;s gun? You are aware that our existence is possible in the first place because of miracles piled atop each other, yes?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Perhaps.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Anyway, are you really going to stop this fight, Ishtar? I&#39;ve never known you to back down when you mean to kill someone.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Shut up. If you insist on keeping this up, you won&#39;t have any justification. But still, if you&#39;re going to keep going, I&#39;m ready for you.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No, I have no intention of continuing.<br> And I apologize for my many indiscretions.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This apology is not for Ishtar, but for the poor human whom she has merged with. I should respect that girl at least, whoever she is and wherever she may be from.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She may be somewhat like Ishtar, but the fact remains that she has managed to mellow Ishtar out somewhat, which can only mean she has a most virtuous soul.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Or maybe strong-willed is a better word for it.<br> The goddess has retained a tendency to rush into things without considering the consequences.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ungh...this piece of junk still loves making those cutting remarks. Are you okay with that, Fujimaru? Does it stress you out?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu&#39;s nice.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Actually, Enkidu&#39;s tough only on you, Ishtar.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Sigh) Suppose this junkpile is still good at playing innocent.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So...can we move on?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Am I correct to assume that you, Ishtar, have already found the source of this phenomenon?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yep, and I can explain.<br> We can talk while we go through the forest. Follow me.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Ooh, an adventure with a hero AND a goddess!?<br> I have a wonderful feeling about this!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do you think so? I find myself overcome with a feeling of purest dread, as though we were being led to the scene of a perfect crime or some such...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Hee-haw! You know the saying! Life is all twisty and turny, like rope! You never know what fate awaits...when you could be kicked off a mountain by an old man&#39;s horse the next minute!!!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh, little sayings like that are so amusing, Master!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You&#39;re right. No matter where we end up...atop a mountain or in a valley...let us pray that we have a good journey.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Not to the gods...but upon the route that Master will be taking.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Does Enkidu really think this group would be able to get to the bottom of this?)</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> (Even on Enkidu&#39;s journey with Gilgamesh,<br> they couldn&#39;t save that child... That beast...)</p><p><strong>--ARROW--:</strong></p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> What a deep, dark forest. It&#39;s still daytime, but this darkness makes it feel like someone&#39;s going to start singing “Hey! Diddle, Diddle!”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, it is still both dark and silent here. This place is one of the Primordial Forests that connect night and day, humans and gods.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I can&#39;t believe you can be so nonchalant about it. Care to enlighten us about a certain duo who went in to destroy that connection?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Sorry, but it&#39;s time to set your past squabbles aside.<br> We have more important things to do right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Or...if Ishtar is letting the issue alone right now,<br> is it safe to say that the situation isn&#39;t as urgent?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...Well, that&#39;s a tough question.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> The Laḫmu are certainly diminishing in number.<br> I&#39;d love to watch that happen at a safe distance.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t really want to kick the hornet&#39;s nest here,<br> but I do have some strong feelings about this.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Said the one who never STOPS kicking the hornet&#39;s nest...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> When are you NOT emotional?</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Come on, I&#39;m trying to be serious here,<br> so don&#39;t tease.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Your effort to confront your true nature is exactly why Master said that.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You put on this air of being the guardian of human prosperity...yet you never listen to humans.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Actually, you probably do listen, but what you hear is twisted up in your bizarre divine mind.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Shut up, you piece of junk. Honestly, I think Kingu had more respect for goddesses like me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Kingu...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That is the soul who inhabited my body in this Singularity, correct?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Would Master and Mash mind telling me about that?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What did Kingu, in my body, do in this world?<br> What did they say? What did they leave behind?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Well, we didn&#39;t see how they died...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t mind.<br> Just tell me what you know.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They may have saved us...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Saved...<br> Wasn&#39;t Kingu your enemy?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We really only know a little about Kingu. But his final actions did make it a little harder to think of him as a true enemy...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> No. We really don&#39;t have enough information to even offer conjecture. Since it&#39;s your body, I think the story would be hard for you to hear, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Heeha!<br> I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much of a problem, Master!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Talking about someone else is never really all that objective! In fact, I&#39;d call all the world&#39;s heroic tales silly little farces, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> And so what can you possibly tell us about Kingu? Everything&#39;s a fraud. That&#39;s how the world turns.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> What a horrible thing to say, Uncle Mephy!<br> Not all stories are so sad!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> When someone tells somebody else&#39;s story,<br> that story becomes another kind of truth!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Master. Enkidu wants to hear Kingu&#39;s tale from your perspective. Please tell them!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> A...story?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmmm. This may be uncalled for, but were I to merely keep quiet and look smug, I would be like a certain insufferable detective...and I won&#39;t have that!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Master, tell your story.<br> We all have a notion of what Enkidu is searching for.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I&#39;m not saying you need to dramatize it.<br> Just tell the story of Kingu, from your own perspective.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And, truth to tell, I find myself curious about this story. Purely for educational reasons, of course.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...Are you sure?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> It&#39;s not really my place to pitch in here, but I can offer some supplemental information if asked.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Besides, this piece of junk lacks emotion. No matter how their body was used, they would accept the truth.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She&#39;s the last person I wanted to point out that I lack emotion, but the rude goddess is right.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about me. I would be satisfied to know anything you are willing to tell me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then I&#39;ll stick to what I know for sure...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> If Senpai is all right with it,<br> then I can also contribute...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Guess I&#39;ll try to elaborate as much as I can!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um...so let me begin first.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Our relationship with Kingu was...complicated from the start.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At first, Kingu pretended to be Enkidu when he appeared to us just after we arrived.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> He turned against us quickly, saying he was the messenger of the Three Goddess Alliance. The truth, though, was that he worshipped Tiamat as his mother.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Tiamat.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. But during our final decisive battle at Uruk...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I see.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My body that claimed to be Kingu...tried to stop Tiamat, the Beast whom he worshipped as his mother.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know what made him change his mind. Though maybe that regal friend of yours might have some more insight in it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But one thing&#39;s for sure: both the chain and the wedge were essential in saving Uruk.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see... So Kingu, or the “me” in this Singularity, managed to hold to his conviction to the very end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What do you mean, the “me” in this Singularity?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> You do say some strange things.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, sorry. I suppose that may have sounded odd, since I&#39;m not Kingu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I mean no insult to his soul,<br> nor do I believe myself to be superior to him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s just that my body...my flesh was created that way. I am designed so that my entire personality is inscribed into the body itself.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So even if a different soul inhabited this corpse, it would be recorded by the world as one of the paths a body created by the gods took.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Paths?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yeah, a path...or perhaps circuit is a better term.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Originally, I did not have a personality.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I was created by Utu and the others as an empty container intended to become the perfect being.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> To put it in modern terms, I was like computer hardware that did not yet have any software installed.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And so upon this empty container, Shamhat, Gil, and some other old allies inscribed the traits of humanity. And that is how I came to be as I am.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> In other words, the “me” that is speaking to you right now is simply a sort of software that happened to be put into operation around this time.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> To the world...rather, the gods who created me...the hardware running the system was more important.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Well that&#39;s pretty weird, I gotta say. Are you trying to say that what was registered onto the Throne was not your soul, but your physical body?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Correct.<br> That&#39;s probably the most sensible explanation.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Specifically, the journey that I took isn&#39;t what&#39;s engraved on the Throne... It would be more accurate to say the hardware called Enkidu was registered.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And that&#39;s why I respect Kingu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Respect?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The path Kingu took is definitely something human from my perspective, and should be praised.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Per the wish of the individual whom Kingu worshipped as a maternal figure, Kingu was able to live in this world as a new human.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> In consequence, he was never a doll used by the gods, but was instead a human with his own will...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Just like any other human who lived in Sumer.<br> He managed to become a being with will, instead of a life-form without it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> With that in mind, it is fair to say that he filled what time was given to him well.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> He confronted the goddess whom he worshipped as his mother, using only the emotions he was born with.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> To act of my own volition was something I could not do until the very end. While that may have been my fate, Kingu managed to escape it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Perhaps I should feel jealous. Or perhaps I should feel relieved that I never held such sentiments.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am merely a tool. To live as a human would be to denounce the role I was assigned.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You do have personality, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you. But that may just be a performance.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It may just be my programming enabling me to mimic humans to better interact with them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Plenty of humans live their lives like machines.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That may be true. But if those people are satisfied with their life that way, that is the result of feeling hope, which is unique to humans.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If someone feels despair...to be able to feel despair...that is just further proof of being human. That is also an emotion that I cannot experience.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh come on! You&#39;re just covering for yourself by stringing together a bunch of logical-seeming nonsense! THIS is why I can&#39;t stand you!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You&#39;re a piece of junk.<br> You broke in just the right ways to gain a personality.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Heh. A complete and perfect entity... You make me laugh! There&#39;s only room for one perfect entity, and that&#39;s me!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But then again...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...maybe that&#39;s why you&#39;re so full of guilt.<br> You regret dying before that stubborn king.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Or maybe you regret your actions and the fate that ultimately tarnished his proud independence.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Whatever it is, you died with regret in your heart. You need to just face the fact that you met your end practically drowning in human emotion.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Look who&#39;s talking... You are the one who cursed me.<br> You even went so far as to call for help.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Oh I&#39;m aware. I will say it as many times as I have to, and I&#39;d do it all over again! I&#39;m sticking to my principles!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> P-please calm down, both of you!<br> We would be repeating...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There is no need to worry.<br> We seem to have another problem now.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Right.<br> It seems we are approaching our destination.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Yep, we&#39;ve got a visual here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But this is...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s a group of Laḫmu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Laḫmu hovering over a giant fragment of...gold chain...?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That&#39;s...a piece of the chain that was used to restrain Tiamat during the decisive battle at Uruk.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m guessing here, but maybe that chain...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...is a remnant of Kingu from the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see. No wonder my Presence Detection didn&#39;t work.<br> It was a part of my own body.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This area is shrouded with the same magical energy as my body. That energy concealed the presence of all the Laḫmu as well.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yep. And do you see that building-sized hunk of flesh the chain is wrapped around?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That&#39;s a piece of Tiamat&#39;s body.<br> It looks like the chain is still trying to restrain it.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> And the Laḫmu are being born as if in protest. But because this age is correcting itself, the chain is more powerful than the flesh.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> That piece of flesh will disappear soon, bringing an end to the chain&#39;s purpose...which means the last remnant of Kingu&#39;s body will vanish.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Unlike this piece of junk here, I don&#39;t have any real problem with Kingu. So I thought the least I could do was watch over him until his end.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I can&#39;t just leave it alone.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s...put it to rest.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Yeah, yeah. You guys are really softies.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But I hope you know...if you agitate it, that bit of flesh will use its last strength to go berserk. If that happens, I can&#39;t guarantee you&#39;d survive.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;ll protect Master.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> And we&#39;re here too!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh ho? We have somehow been included in this god-killing troupe! What are your thoughts, old, aged man?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> This peppy Mephy is as excited as can be to get some god killing done! Wheehaha!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Argh! This is exactly what I was worried about!<br> Well, we did come all this way, so I will help!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> After all, such damning blasphemy as killing the remnant of a goddess is just the sort of dirty job fit for Mephistopheles and myself!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Thank you, everyone.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And you too, Kingu...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I respect you. Truly. I respect that you have kept to your conviction even after ending up like that.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m going to take care of everything now.<br> And...I hope you will forgive me for taking over.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The Laḫmu have detected you!<br> Please be careful, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Looks like that chunk of Tiamat has also detected you.<br> Don&#39;t let it eat you or anything!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The readings of Tiamat and her Laḫmu are beginning to disappear!</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ... ...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Your protection of Mother&#39;s body till the end is admirable, but then I came and trampled over your desires for my own ends.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If you are to curse someone, it should be neither humanity nor Master. You should curse me, even though I could not become truly human.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...0;0;f　ffs　smi　zai　t5.</p><p><strong>Laḫmu:</strong><br> ...30;m4　0;0;f　6j5を　30;m4<br> ...6j5f　...pte0　...4o/ue</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you. I&#39;m grateful.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...That&#39;s right.<br> This is my sign of appreciation.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on, Enkidu?<br> Why are you standing in front of Kingu&#39;s chain?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I wanted to...thank him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you, Kingu.<br> You were indeed a human. And a hero.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you...proud soul who helped to maintain the connection between humans, land, and sky.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Enkidu absorbed the chain fragment!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They fused!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Calm down. That was originally part of Enkidu. Absorbing it back into themselves is nothing strange.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes...it feels like a missing piece of me has finally been returned.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I synchronized with the chain and incorporated it back to my Spirit Origin. At the same time, a part of Kingu&#39;s Spirit Origin came flowing into me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Maybe one day,<br> Kingu may manifest in my Spirit Origin.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My eyes might turn blue sometimes, but that&#39;s just a part of the software in Enkidu&#39;s body.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And...a part of Kingu&#39;s heart is also becoming part of me. I can see the journey he took. I can see how it came to an end...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So Gil really did become a wonderful king.<br> That...is a relief.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hm...this may just be me, but I sense that the quality of your Spirit Origin has changed.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My connection to the world may have changed slightly.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My Presence Detection doesn&#39;t sharpen one&#39;s mind.<br> It&#39;s a subsystem that allows me to become one with the world and identify anything out of place.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now that I have inherited the legacy and story of Kingu,<br> I am now able to further integrate myself into anything connected to Chaldea&#39;s world.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now I can melt my very existence into the world. Even if only for an instant, I may be able to evade an enemy&#39;s attacks.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The power that was inherited from Kingu...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> What an amazing power!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Whether it can actually be used would probably depend on how much my Spirit Origin has bonded with Chaldea and Master.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Either way, the issue here has been corrected.<br> Let&#39;s return to Chaldea, Master.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Eh?</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Aren&#39;t you going to go see Gilgamesh?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You know that fool would hurry over–whether he be in the underworld or on the throne–the moment he learns someone&#39;s raiding Uruk&#39;s treasury.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> More than that, he would really hurry over if he knew you were here.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well, it would be nice if I saw him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But the Gilgamesh here, now, is the Gil who&#39;s already said goodbye to me. He is a king now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think Gilgamesh is the sort to treat you differently because of his status...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Maybe not for Gilgamesh. But the people who live in this age are a different matter.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure the people will be fearful. They might be afraid that I may take Gil&#39;s soul to the underworld on some adventure.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And, honestly...I might really do that.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The people of Uruk aren&#39;t that fragile.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Really? I see... Then there really isn&#39;t any reason for me to see him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Gil became a king who made his citizens strong...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And that knowledge alone is as good as meeting Gil and speaking with him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yeah. But then again, if the people of Uruk are that resilient, maybe I really would take Gil off on an adventure without having to worry.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you really going to take him?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Who knows? Another trip through a forest or over a mountain does sound fun...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yeah... Even my own software might determine that being with him is the optimal decision.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Kidnapping, you say!? Taking Gil as the adventurer is one thing, but taking Gil the king by force should be easy as pie!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No... Whether Gil and I want to or not, we would have gone on a journey had the fates decreed it to be so. That&#39;s how it is.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> This sounds like some kind of riddle.<br> But I&#39;m sure it would have been a wonderful journey!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course it would.<br> A journey with Gil could never be boring.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This entire planet is his garden. But Gil isn&#39;t the sort of person who would be satisfied with just a stroll through something already his.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The moment he finishes walking every inch of this planet, he&#39;ll probably head out into space.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think he would have a spaceship...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Haha, who knows? That treasury of his is a miniaturized version of human history. Whether such a vehicle is within it is up to how curious he is.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Would you want to go on a journey through space?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know. I am a doll that is meant to be part of the planet.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> However, should somebody travel through the stars with Gil, I may entrust them with some sort of wish.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;d wish that the time we spent together–even if only a portion–could light the way on their new journey.</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> You really can&#39;t be honest with yourself, huh?<br> I never knew what you were thinking...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m aware that others find it difficult to understand me. But that is just how I have always been.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And I wanted to make that clear for Master.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So, please, think of me simply as a tool. My only wish is to be used effectively in your service, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Please don&#39;t say anything so sad!<br> Senpai has never thought of [♂ his /♀️ her} Servants as tools.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t recommend that approach. If the time comes,<br> use me until I break to help yourself survive.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> There&#39;s nothing wrong with being both human and tool.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Anyone who mistreats their tools should be punished.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Master, you really are soft. You&#39;re the complete opposite of Gil... You are certainly unique.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Or, perhaps...<br> Perhaps you are the one who is more human.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If so, having been a Servant to a human such as you is an honor.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> While the position of best friend is one that has already been filled, if you consider me to be a trustworthy tool, then I will answer your call and serve you as best I can in my brief existence.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That is why I wish you to use me until I break.<br> That is the purpose of my coming to Chaldea.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enkidu...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmph. After hearing all that from you...<br> You really are a bit of a fool, aren&#39;t you, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Professor?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah, yes... Enkidu, you are like a pure, innocent, newborn doll. You would be an easy mark for an unscrupulous villain like myself.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> How intriguing. I suppose I could not hope to match the Professor or the intricacies of his schemes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Now, now. This smug grin isn&#39;t just because you&#39;ve stated the obvious. I was speaking of the attitude that you and Kingu take toward the world.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> With Kingu...toward the world?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Kingu adopted your form and went on a rampage. Any citizen of Uruk who saw you would surely think their enemy has returned for them.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True. Chaos may ensue.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Exactly.<br> That&#39;s why I–</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> On the other hand, you have not blamed Kingu for any of this.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> He tarnished your name, your reputation. And yet you praised his conviction and incorporated him into your own Spirit Origin!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Do you intend to embrace not only his soul,<br> but also every bit of tragedy and hatred he created?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I will say it once more:<br> you, my little clay doll, are a fool.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You&#39;re neither good nor bad.<br> Just a foolishly honest...story of a hero.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I think I know why you were always interested in us.<br> I think Enkidu is very similar to us.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my, oh my...did you not realize this!?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> I was born a devil...while Nursery was born a story.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> And add in the old, aged man, a man who was inscribed upon the world&#39;s Throne as the ultimate villain...and the correlation is quite simple.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Though, I do think the old, aged man is somewhat different than the two of us... Why do you think that is, old, aged man?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Firstly, I told you to drop the “aged” bit. Let us set aside for the moment whether I should be here or not.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> We have all, through the intervention of some other entity, been forced to be and act in certain ways.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In your particular case, you were assigned a role by the gods themselves, but you defied their decree.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I do not deny that. I did indeed defy my reason for my existence, my purpose for living.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m different than Kingu. I did not gain a soul.<br> I simply abandoned my very being.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> However...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The reason you wanted to learn more about us is that you are searching for an answer, for some sort of saving grace. Or, that was my initial belief.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But my calculations require a bit of alteration and correcting on this short journey.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You sought salvation in understanding us not for yourself, but for another. Am I wrong?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Heh. You really are quite expressive, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And so we arrive back at why I called you a fool.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> That applies to dolls and tools...humans and heroes.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Well, honestly I think fools are quite boring, but I don&#39;t hate them. I am, after all, a teacher.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I would hate to see another accidentally gain a sense of justice like Watson, but it may be interesting to see them succumb to evil like the spider woman.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Me...sinking into either good or evil...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Intriguing. Do you think that could even be possible for me?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I&#39;m really not interested in this conversation, but thought I&#39;d let you know we&#39;re ready to Rayshift.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can put Enkidu&#39;s decision about their future on hold for now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ishtar, thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.<br> We&#39;re friends, after all.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But I&#39;m warning you: never bring that piece of junk back here again.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It would be better if you would disappear from this age. In fact, it would be BEST if you just disappeared entirely from human history.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Ah, unfortunately for you, as long as humanity thrives here, I will keep existing, even as a remnant of a guardian god.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> U-um, since I find the smiles they have while they&#39;re glaring at each other terrifying, I&#39;m commencing the Rayshift! Senpai, are you ready?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Ready when you are.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> See you later, Ishtar!</p><hr><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> ...<br> There they go.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> So that hardheaded king never showed up.</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> But he had to have sensed that Enkidu was here...</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Those two really are impossible. I never could get my head around what they were thinking!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> Argh! Just thinking about it makes me so mad!</p><p><strong>Ishtar:</strong><br> I&#39;m gonna go raid Uruk&#39;s treasury for jewels to make myself feel better!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Welcome back, Senpai!<br> Is everyone else okay, too?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Yeah. They made me walk quite a ways, and I feel I must have aged a few years on the trip.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is something the matter, Enkidu?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well, this journey taught me many things.<br> It will be quite difficult to assimilate all this data.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m not so sure if it was all right for me to have incorporated Kingu into my humble Spirit Origin...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Or perhaps it would be better to allow Kingu to take over as the Heroic Spirit for this body.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Enkidu...</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my, oh my...<br> You really are overthinking this!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Mephistopheles?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> From where I stand, there&#39;s no distinction between the two of you at all!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Why do you think that?</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Gods create. Humans form connections. And they all go back to the ground. That is the duty and inevitable end of all who walk upon this world.</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> If you say that Kingu was human, why wouldn&#39;t YOU be able to say you are human too, since you were all born from the same source, hmm?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> That is one way to think of it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Kingu&#39;s soul came from Tiamat, and he was able to forge many connections with humans in the Singularity.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> The software that was used was the only thing that was different, but there&#39;s hardly any distinction between the way the two of you lived your lives.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Admittedly I never would have looked to Mephistopheles for that sort of sentiment!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oooh, oooh, that stings!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I also don&#39;t think you should worry too much.</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> Many stories come from some sort of wish, but the interpretation can always differ in endless ways depending on the storyteller and listener!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> So, please cheer up, great hero from an old, old, ooold story!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> One of these days, someone will read your amazing story in such a beautiful light! I&#39;m sure of it!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> I was also able to forge many connections, and that&#39;s how I got to meet Master and many wonderful children who would listen to my story!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I see.<br> You may be right.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> With all of your help,<br> I believe I have made some progress.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What matters is not why I was created, but how I interact with others, how I live, and how all of that connects...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> A long time ago, before I met Gil or Shamhat, or even before I was among the animals in the forest...I had an encounter with someone else.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But I couldn&#39;t make any connections. I simply returned the gods&#39; creation back to the land and soil.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Once more...if I can meet this soul one more time,<br> I may be able to create a connection for her story.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m glad I was able to hear from people like you...who were created to act a certain way.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> My wish now is to update my software with the memories I&#39;ve just made and take them back to the Throne.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you, Mephistopheles.<br> And you too, Nursery Rhyme. And you, old, aged man.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Why must you bring that up even now!? We were JUST about to conclude on a pleasant note!!!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> You have an uncanny penchant for teasing, don&#39;t you!?<br> I still recall what happened during that race!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Perhaps Chaldea has changed me.<br> Or perhaps it is Master&#39;s influence.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you, Master and Mash.<br> I vow to continue serving as your sword and shield.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I just hope I&#39;m worthy of your vow.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I can assure you that you are a Master worth protecting.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I don&#39;t need a shield. I have a Mash.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> S-Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ah, right.<br> Then I will focus on being your sword.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Are you joking too, Enkidu!?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Either way, good work everyone. The chef in the cafeteria is making a tropical-style curry using summer vegetables, so go and have some.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Tropical...style? Sounds interesting!<br> Let&#39;s go, Senpai!</p><p><strong>Mephistopheles:</strong><br> Oh my...curry, you say? My Ticktock Bomb is quite tropical as well, so let&#39;s try mixing that in!</p><p><strong>Nursery Rhyme:</strong><br> It must be Uncle Emiya&#39;s curry!<br> I&#39;m sure it&#39;s quite mild! Let&#39;s go!</p><p><strong>E：Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh my days. All this commotion has caused me a bit of back pain, but I did manage to squirm my way out from losing that poker game earlier.</p><p><strong>E：Moriarty:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>E：Moriarty:</strong><br> (But learning about Enkidu&#39;s true nature was a stroke of luck.

You looked like you were having a terrible nightmare...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Does that mean I was sleeping?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Yes. Your head was swaying quite a bit. At any rate, I&#39;m glad to see your consciousness is stable.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Talk about REMjà vu.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;m impressed how casually you came up with a new word that so succinctly explains your situation, Master.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I see. So you were inadvertently using your unique skill that lets you share REM cycles with contracted Servants.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That said, you seemed like you were having an especially bad nightmare in this particular REM REM state...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> For a moment, I was worried it might be another Shimousa situation, so I&#39;m glad that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Especially since we don&#39;t have as many people here to support you right now...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Oh, right. All the Heroic Spirits are...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. 2019 is almost over,<br> so we&#39;ve been busy getting things ready.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Uh... Can you remind me why that is again?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know you must be exhausted right now, Senpai, but please try to wake up.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s December 2019 now, remember? There are only a few days until a new administration will be taking over Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> We&#39;ve started dismissing all of Chaldea&#39;s Heroic Spirits in preparation for the new director&#39;s arrival...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...but we still have a lot of work to do explaining the situation to them.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have to talk to Kiyohime and Raikou before tomorrow then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> That&#39;s right. All the Heroic Spirits trust you implicitly, after all. I think there will be a lot of joyful farewells.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;ll have to find a way to get Batty out of her kotatsu by tomorrow then...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> It&#39;s not just Osakabehime. A lot of Servants have succumbed to her kotatsu&#39;s magical energy.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;ll be sad saying goodbye to everyone too, but it&#39;s our job to see all the Heroic Spirits off with–</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Ah, if it isn&#39;t Master! My humblest apologies, but would you mind stepping aside!?</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> About thirty centimeters to the right, to be precise!<br> If you must know why, it&#39;s for the sake of my poor back!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I recognize that voice! (Stay firmly in place)</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Khh! [♂ He /♀️ She} responded two seconds later than I&#39;d calculated! At this rate, I&#39;m not going to make it!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> Well, if I can&#39;t go around, I&#39;ll just have to go above! Any good criminal should be able to hop a fence, after all!</p><p><strong>F：???:</strong><br> I may not look anything like Cleopatra, but I can still imitate her grace and agility!

Ghh...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Ah, Nietzsche! Not only is God dead, but now He is joined by my poor back! This has been utterly blasphemous for my joints!

Come back tomorrow, and I&#39;ll show you the true face of evil!!!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Gotta watch your back in your ripe old years!

As they say these days, you&#39;ve really upped your game! At this rate, you may never need me to rescue you in midair again...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> While it both heartens and saddens me to see you grow so quickly, it also makes it painfully clear to me just how old I&#39;ve become in both spirit AND body!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Fortunately, I&#39;ve grown wiser as well as older so I still have plenty of life lessons left to impart!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> So I&#39;ll keep working my poor old back to the bone until I&#39;ve taught you every last one of them!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Oh drat. It figures my back would start acting up right after I said that... I daresay, growing old is the worst!</p><hr><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But for the moment, my work here is done! Farewell!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There he goes again, still holding his back...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I guess it just goes to show we can&#39;t let our guard down until we&#39;ve said goodbye to every last Servant.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> It kind of seemed to me like he was playing things up more than usual.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Seems a safe bet that he&#39;s up to something again...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?<br> Is that...Meunière?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> Fujimaru! Mash!<br> Did you happen to see Moriarty around here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, yes, actually. He just ran off that way...<br> Why, did something happen?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> He messed with the simulator so he could hide out in virtual space and avoid being dismissed.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> Luckily, Holmes and Da Vinci figured it out and stopped him right at the end, but that slippery old man&#39;s still out there.</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> Dammit, I don&#39;t even wanna think about what the new director might&#39;ve said if they&#39;d seen the simulator acting up like that...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I guess Moriarty really doesn&#39;t want to leave...</p><hr><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> Lucky me. This new director&#39;s almost certainly going to be a first-class mage, so there&#39;s no way they won&#39;t see through any tricks like that.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What about the simulator? Is it repaired now?</p><p><strong>Chaldea Staff:</strong><br> Yeah, it should be good to go. We&#39;ve got a few Heroic Spirits in there testing it out now. It worked out well, since they were saying they wanted to get in one last workout before they leave.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I might as well say goodbye to them now then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Let&#39;s check in on them. I also want to see how the simulator&#39;s doing.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good point, Senpai. Let&#39;s go pay them a visit.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Teams Two and Three, you focus on restoring the simulator&#39;s stability. Team One, you make sure the math keeps checking out. Team Four, make sure you&#39;re ready to eject them by force whenever I give the word!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Just make sure you don&#39;t eject them too quickly. We want to make sure they&#39;ve expended a good amount of magical energy first.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, and get Fujimaru in here too in case we need [♂ him /♀️ her}!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> There&#39;s a good chance [♂ he&#39;s /♀️ she&#39;s} the only one who&#39;ll be able to contain this situa–</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh good, you&#39;re already here! Great timing! Who knew my genius even accounted for good fortune and happenstance!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What&#39;s going on!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So much for peace and quiet...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> The simulator&#39;s instruments are all going crazy!<br> What in the world is happening here!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I could tell you, but it&#39;d be faster if you just take a look at what&#39;s going on in there for yourselves.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Okay, I can see the video feed.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh!?<br> Is that...!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That&#39;s Enkidu and...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Is that Mordred!?</p><hr><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wh-why are they doing this!?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I asked a few Servants with time on their hands to test out the simulator after the professor messed with it.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting this kind of human error, though. Now I wonder if the professor planned this too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Somebody get the Round Table and Uruk kings in here!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I wouldn&#39;t if I were you. That would almost certainly complicate things by a factor of five, at least.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Worst-case scenario, all of Chaldea could end up razed to the ground before the new administration even has a chance to take over.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> D-did something happen between them!? This is well beyond a routine simulator training battle!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly. That&#39;s why we can&#39;t just shut it down.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> If they came back here now, they&#39;d just keep on fighting inside Chaldea itself.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So it would seem...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> To be perfectly honest, I&#39;ve never seen Mordred like this before...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Yeah. Not even during the Camelot Singularity.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s actually scarier that we&#39;re not hearing cursing left and right.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> True. Usually, Mordred&#39;s humanity tends to keep all those fierce anger and hostility in check.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But right now, there&#39;s no Gift or curse to blame it on. Mordred&#39;s just so enraged that any other consideration has fallen by the wayside.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Judging from how seriously the fight is, I&#39;d bet Mordred doesn&#39;t even remember going into the simulator.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So Enkidu did something to make Mordred this upset!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What could it possibly have been!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> We can figure that out later. Right now, we have to stop them!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s any of our business...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> No, I think it might be better if you knew what caused this before you get involved, Fujimaru.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Here, take a look at this footage from the simulator.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, just make sure Mordred doesn&#39;t find out this footage was being recorded, okay?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We can&#39;t stop them from finding out we “just happened” to overhear their conversation when we eventually go in to mediate this conflict...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...but you need to be very careful you don&#39;t bring up any related details. That&#39;s how sensitive this subject is.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Th-that much?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> After all, if you don&#39;t know what sparked Mordred&#39;s ire so badly, you could end up inadvertently touching on it again and making things worse.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Of course, some people would only end up blurting out this kind of knowledge, so you should be honored that I trust you enough to share it with you.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Pulling up the footage now...<br> Okay, here&#39;s the relevant part.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> No way!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But all right. I was just plannin&#39; on takin&#39; a break anyway, so I don&#39;t mind hearin&#39; ya out.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Thank you! I greatly appreciate it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I was just hoping you could tell me about your salvation.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Say what?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> You see, I heard a woman by the name of Morgan created you for the sole purpose of destroying King Arthur.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Eventually, you succeeded at destroying King Arthur and ending his reign, just as Morgan designed you to.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am familiar with King Arthur&#39;s government, and have analyzed the accomplishments it achieved in its prime.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> So I can tell that destroying King Arthur and ending his reign must have been an incredibly difficult, nearly impossible challenge.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Which is why I thought you would be the perfect person to ask.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Given that your sole purpose for existence was the destruction of King Arthur...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...did you feel any sense of fulfillment or the like when you succeeded in doing what you had been created for?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course, King Arthur was also your father. Was there any change in your thoughts or feelings at the moment you devastated his kingdom?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If you had survived after fulfilling your mother&#39;s wish...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What I mean is, now that you are effectively alive again as a Servant...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...what drives you to go on living now that your purpose for being is long since fulfilled? I want to know.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Wha... Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh–</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I always thought Enkidu might do something like this eventually...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What was that green-haired lunatic thinking!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> So that&#39;s the ax of Uruk flying off the handle...</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> I did hear from people with connections to Uruk that Enkidu could sometimes say things that&#39;d cause even the King of Heroes to cringe, but I didn&#39;t know what they meant until today.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Still, that bluntness is arguably something you both have in common.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Depending on the situation, it can be both a weakness and a strength...though in this case, it&#39;s clearly the former.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Is this really the time for coolheaded analysis!? We need to hurry and stop them before it&#39;s too late!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Exactly. Just having them exit the simulator now won&#39;t do anything to address the root cause of this conflict...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> ...and like I said before, there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;d just keep on fighting inside Chaldea proper anyway.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> So we need to find a way to get them to stand down while they&#39;re still in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I&#39;ll go in and get them to stop right now.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Are you sure you want to do that? You could just talk to them over the intercom from here.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> But then again, in your case, talking to them face-to-face probably has much better odds.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I think some Primordial Lanugo should make a good reward.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Like I told you before, I only wish we could get our hands on some. Just once, it would be nice not to have to worry about resources...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, if you can joke around like that, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine, especially since you seem well aware of what&#39;s at stake. ...You DO know what&#39;s at stake,<br> right?</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> All right then, we&#39;re counting on you yet again. When all&#39;s said and done, I hope you&#39;ll be able to look back on your time at Chaldea fondly.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, and be careful. Simulator or not, we only just finished tuning it up, so don&#39;t forget to pay attention to your mind&#39;s stability.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> !<br> Uh, ooh, uh!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Fran! I didn&#39;t know you were in here too!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh, uh.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay. Let&#39;s go stop them together.</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> There they are!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> But given how fiercely they&#39;re fighting, I&#39;m not sure they&#39;ll even hear you if you call to them...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Safety comes first. I&#39;ll shout at them from far away to get their attention.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Good point. If you wander too close and get caught in their cross fire, it could have a severely detrimental effect on your mind, simulator or not.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Still, given how tense things are between them right now, I&#39;m not sure words alone will be enough. If we want to get their attention, we might need to make a sound so loud that they think they&#39;re being attacked...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Go big or go home. They&#39;re sure to stop if we bring down the whole castle!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Senpai!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Um, that seems like it might be a little too excessive, even for a simulation...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Besides, if we just start relying on brute force in situations like this, I&#39;m worried we might end up deciding to outright destroy Castle Csejte someday...</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Guess there&#39;s no choice but to bring out the Noble Phantasm guns then.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> In that case, can I ask you to use your Noble Phantasm?</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh, ah!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Blasted Tree!!!</p><p><strong>Enkidu &amp; Mordred:</strong><br> !!!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Fran!? I thought I told you to get out of–</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...<br> ...Master!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What brings you here, Master?<br> You should know it&#39;s not safe.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> First things first: please, put your weapons away!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Stop fighting and hear me out!</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Stay outta this, Master. Got shit to do with you.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Whatever Enkidu told you, I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t meant to offend.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Killing Enkidu isn&#39;t going to make you feel better. You know that, right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> (Sigh) All right, all right. &#39;Sides, I can tell you&#39;ll hit me with your Noble Phantasm next if I don&#39;t stop.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Okay Enkidu, explain yourself.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Okay Enkidu, I think you should start with an apology.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes, it seems I should.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m still not entirely sure why, but I understand now that my question touched a very sore spot.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I hope you can believe me when I say it was never my intention to hurt you, and I&#39;m truly sorry for the misunderstanding.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ......</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ......</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Mordred...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Tch... All right. Fine. Whatever.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Enough of that damn pitying look, Master.<br> I&#39;m feelin&#39; better now I got that outta my system.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> &#39;Sides, I know this uncooked bean sprout here&#39;s still technically your Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, they pissed me off to where I was seein&#39; red...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...but your guarantee that they weren&#39;t tryin&#39; to piss me off is enough for me, Master. I&#39;ll let it go.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Then please rest assured. I can promise you that the only person I would knowingly choose to insult is Ishtar.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Even if you were the most wicked being to ever walk the earth, I would still hold you in respect.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Tch, you got a really goddamn irritating way of putting things, don&#39;t ya... Sound like Kay, dammit. Makes it real hard to tell if you&#39;re bein&#39; polite or just puttin&#39; up a front.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Oh, this is such a relief. Thank you for understanding.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Although, I still don&#39;t understand why you fought back, Enkidu. If you didn&#39;t mean to upset Mordred, couldn&#39;t you have just focused on defending and running away?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, that&#39;s simple. I fought back because I sensed genuine anger and hostility.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Fighting an opponent whose emotions are running hot in that way can be an excellent way to learn more about them.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> For example, what it is they&#39;re angry about,<br> or why exactly they want to kill me.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> That is...a terrible reason to fight someone to the death.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Don&#39;t misunderstand; I wasn&#39;t fighting to the death myself. Though I can&#39;t deny I find the competition fulfilling.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The people I met in Uruk taught me there are some things one can only understand by comparing weapons in battle.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It was in battle that Gil taught me the power of wisdom and strength; Shamhat, the power of affection; and Siduri, the power of faith.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> I didn&#39;t know you were such a battle junkie, Enkidu.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Battle junkie...? Well, I don&#39;t think I would go that far.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Though I do admit that the thrill I experienced during my three-day, three-night battle with Gil is something I still remember fondly, even as a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Gil enjoyed it a great deal too, as I recall. Maybe we should do that again in the simulator one of these days.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I think you might have trouble getting permission to use the simulator for seventy-two consecutive hours...</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> At any rate, may I suggest we leave the simulator now? We still have to report to Da Vinci, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I remember that Par said she was making berry smoothies in the cafeteria, so maybe we could continue this conversation while having one of those?</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Welcome back, guys! Great work in there. I was following along from the outside, so I&#39;m all caught up.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Go on ahead to the cafeteria. They should all be ready for you by now.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> (Who&#39;s they...?) Understood!<br> Come on, Senpai, let&#39;s all go to the cafeteria then.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh, uh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> What in the world are Demonic Beasts doing in Chaldea!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Get back, Mash!</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Those look like...the ones from Sumer?<br> No... They&#39;re not quite the same...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ha! I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doin&#39; here, but this works out real nice.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I still got some steam I wanted to blow off, and you assholes look like just the tick–</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey! That was mine!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m set to protect Master as my highest priority, so that&#39;s what I did.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Still, seeing as there&#39;s plenty left for you, don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a little premature to get angry?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Tch. Guess you really are Master&#39;s Servant.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, I guess I can fight side by side with you for now, Lancer. Just make sure you stay outta my way!</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What were those things doing here?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah!

What&#39;s a forest doin&#39; in the middle of the damn cafeteria!?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh?<br> Uh! Ah!</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What is it, Fran?<br> ...Huh!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The door we just came through is...gone...</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ha. Guess this means we&#39;re trapped in here then. Though I still don&#39;t know how the hell you get trapped in a forest.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Anyway, these are some seriously huge trees.<br> What&#39;s their deal?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> These are...Lebanese cedars.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Cedars? Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> But they&#39;re enormous...</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I understand why you&#39;d be confused, Master.<br> They are true cedars, in the pine family.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> They can grow up to fifty meters tall,<br> and were often used to build boats.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...However, I don&#39;t believe any forest this large still exists in your time.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> So this is a Lebanese cedar forest?<br> Then, does that mean–</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, it does.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This is the same forest of the gods that Gil and I put an end to.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who brought us here, or for what purpose...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...but if this is indeed the Cedar Forest from the Epic of Gilgamesh, there&#39;s a strong chance they were targeting me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m just sorry the rest of you happened to get caught up in it too.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Don&#39;t worry about it.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It&#39;s okay. This kind of thing happens all the time in Chaldea.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, so what the hell did you mean when you said “everyone” should all be here?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> &#39;Cause I sure as shit doubt you meant the Chaldea people.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Good question.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> While I admit I&#39;m reluctant to get into this, since it has to do with the very essence of my systems–or rather, the fundamental areas that hinder them...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...it wouldn&#39;t be fair to you, or to Master, to keep you in the dark after I pried so deeply into your story.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t have regrets... Not exactly. The only remorse I felt when I died were my feelings towards him.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> You never have been shy about sharing those kinds of things, have you?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I share them if I need to, and hide them if I must. That&#39;s all there is to it.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Still...there may be some things I only feel comfortable telling you because you&#39;re my Master.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Come to think of it, do you still hang out with the king?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, Master, you&#39;re talking about Goldie, right? I don&#39;t want you calling anyone “king” besides my old man, at least when you&#39;re around me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll just have to deal with that on your own time, Mordred. Gilgamesh is just as responsible for Uruk as your king was for Britain.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It would be one thing if it were just you and Master here, but when there are others around, he deserves to be addressed as King Gilgamesh.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Still, if you just can&#39;t contain your affection for him, and don&#39;t mind if he challenges you to a fight over it, I suppose you could get away with not calling him by his full title.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That so? All right, all right, I got it already.</p><hr><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Actually, are you guys really friends?<br> I didn&#39;t think Goldie really DID friends...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> He may not, but Gilgamesh and I are indeed dear friends, nonetheless. I can say without any reservation that there is no one else like him.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> While we do sometimes talk for a long time, it&#39;s rare for us to do so proactively, on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Besides, we don&#39;t need words to truly understand one another.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Then what do you need?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It&#39;s difficult to explain... But I suppose, in our case, just spending time together is enough.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> We already got all of our grief and regrets and other feelings out of the way when we were alive.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Even if Gil were to die in front of my eyes right now, I would just smile and say “See you again.”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sure Gil feels the same way. A single grieving per loved one is more than enough, after all.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I know some Heroic Spirits are very positive when it comes to death, but wow, I never thought about it like that before.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I think that&#39;s fine. Gil and I are both well aware that our personalities are easily misunderstood.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> This may sound arrogant, but if Gil were to make a new friend now, I don&#39;t think they would be anything like me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> In fact, the only thing we would have in common would be that we both have a nose, a mouth, and eyes.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yet despite that, I&#39;m also certain this person would be someone with whom Gil would go to the ends of the stars...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Someone who could give Gil things I never could.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> For example...King Gilgamesh only truly began to walk side by side with the people of Uruk after I died.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That was when he began to see them not as mere life-forms, but real people with their own minds and wills. They broadened his world more than I ever could.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Learning that fact alone is enough to make me glad I became a Heroic Spirit. That knowledge is just as valuable to me as a thousand moonlit nights spent with Gil.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Gotcha. That sounds kind of like Mo and Fran.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh? Uh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> C&#39;mon, Master, it&#39;s not that hard to understand her, right? Like right now, she&#39;s just sayin&#39; “You really don&#39;t understand me?”</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Actually, hold up! You didn&#39;t say anything weird to Fran like you did to me, did you?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t think so? I understand she&#39;s also an artificial life-form, but to me, she&#39;s no different from any other being.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Of course, if Doctor Frankenstein had embedded a curselike system in her, then she might have piqued my curiosity.</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So that&#39;s how it is. Man, you really are a complete pain in the ass, aren&#39;t you?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m aware I can be difficult for others to accept.</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Besides...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Master, Mash, I think it would be best if you stepped back.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> It seems sheor rather,<br> they...have noticed I&#39;m here.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Huh? Enkidu, what are you talking about?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> They are my very first friends.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...In fact, you could even say they raised me.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> They raised you...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Something&#39;s comin&#39; our way, Master! Watch yourself!</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...!</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell are these things?<br> More Babylonia Demonic Beasts?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> She–I mean, they...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...are human.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> ...Really?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Ahh... It&#39;s been so long since I last saw them.<br> So very, very long...</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Wh a y o re 　ou 　?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell was that!?<br> Are they tryin&#39; ta talk or something?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I don&#39;t understand them...but it looks like each Demonic Beast is saying a different part of each word...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I see. So this version of you is from a time after we parted ways.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I was hoping that wouldn&#39;t be the case, since you haven&#39;t fused into a single entity...but it seems that was too much to hope for.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Still... Even so, I have to ask.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Do you no longer live in these woods? Is there truly not so much as a tiny fragment left?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Tell me, Huwawa.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> 　Hu 　　　　　　　　　　　wa　　　　　　wa...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> ...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Who&#39;s Huwawa?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Huwawa... Isn&#39;t that</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Huwawa was the guardian of the forest of the gods.<br> At least, until Gil and I killed her.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I&#39;d heard she was a dreadful monster that the gods ordered to protect their Lebanese Cedar Forest...</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> I can only imagine how powerful she must have been for King Gilgamesh to fear her.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Wait, really? That pompous Goldie guy was afraid of these things? They don&#39;t look that tough to me...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh...<br> Uh, ahh.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What is it, Fran?<br> ...What do ya mean they still haven&#39;t been put together?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> !<br> I see. So you can tell, too.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes, that&#39;s true. Those girls there are a lot like you, before you were born.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The only difference is that their body was made from souls, while yours was made from other bodies...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...and that they were given life not through science and engineering, but the gods&#39; Authority and blessing.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No...not with a blessing. Huwawa is a complete human, born together with a curse.</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> What do you mean, a complete human?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I wish I could tell you more...but it seems the circumstances won&#39;t allow that.</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Who are you Who This is fun Who are you It&#39;s you Sad Protect Woods Help me Hate</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> You kill the forest HELP Enemy Kill Pain Hurt Happy ME Gods Kill</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Kill them Help me NO Forest Protect Help me Help me Help me WRONG Help me</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Die Enemy WRONG Humans Gods Kill I AM Kill Forest GOOD Protect</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Forest Who I I I Who A Dream You RUN No Die Die Kill</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Ahh Ow Huh It hurts EN Why No Argh KI Ow Ow It hurts It hurts</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong><br> Hate Hate Hate hate kill kill ki die kill kill die DUUUUU</p><p><strong>Huwawa?:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, I don&#39;t know what the hell&#39;s goin&#39; on, but it looks like these things&#39;re done talkin&#39;! It&#39;s okay to kill &#39;em, yeah!?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now I see...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know who&#39;s doing this, or why...but it seems they want me to reenact that situation.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...And I will. I won&#39;t hesitate to do so.<br> Not now that I&#39;m a Servant.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I am Enkidu, a Lancer. I have been rebooted to serve as humanity&#39;s guardian.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No matter where we are, or what the situation may be, I cannot allow my Master to come to harm.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I must fulfill the role that has been given to me, for Kingu–with whom I integratedas much as for myself.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I truly am sorry about this.<br> But I won&#39;t ask for your forgiveness.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Even if this is only a fleeting dream, or illusion, or a bug in my system...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I will still not hesitate to remove you from these woods.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Besides, I have already experienced this regret before, so it should not be so difficult to manage again.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Since I never did try to save you...it&#39;s only fitting that I experience it again.</p><p><strong>--BATTLE--:</strong></p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...Is it over? And actually, hang on.<br> What was that kid doing here!?</p><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Ah! Senpai, look! Over there!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> The corpses are all gathering around the child...</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> They&#39;re becoming...a single mass...?</p><hr><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Ugh...</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Not...over...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> The hell?

What is that!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> A giant arm...coming out of the ground!?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> It looks like...it&#39;s stopping Enkidu&#39;s Noble Phantasm!?</p><hr><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I never had any regrets when I was alive. I believed I&#39;d always done the best I could in any given situation.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Even when I was tearing out their guts, I couldn&#39;t ensure they were dead. Even when I was twisting off their heads, they continued to damn and curse me.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> It wasn&#39;t until King Gilgamesh stopped me that I realized there was something wrong with my systems.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I wonder what sort of expression I wore on my face while I continued to rip out my former kin&#39;s entrails.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I was sure the only regrets I have had to do with Gilgamesh, but it seems one of my systems was updated after I became a Heroic Spirit.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Now, I hear the rancorous voices of thousands of people that once rang out from the guardians&#39; entrails.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If only those voices were directed at those who had hurt their owners.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Both Gilgamesh and I were prepared to be hated for what we had done.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> However, those poor children within that monster couldn&#39;t see anyone or anything.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> They had become mere puppets of the gods–animated chunks of meat that couldn&#39;t even understand why they suffered or what the object of their hatred should be.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Yes. This must be the system humans call “karma.”</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> I robbed those girls of their future. I tried to save them, even though I didn&#39;t know how.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> In the end, all I did was cause them to suffer for a very, very long time.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If the situation in which I find myself now is the price I must pay for that sin, then I must be ready to accept it.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Except...now I have a new regret.<br> What about my Master? Is [♂ he /♀️ she} okay?</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> If [♂ he /♀️ she} is, then I know [♂ he /♀️ she} will be fine without me.<br> Once [♂ he /♀️ she} returns to Chaldea, [♂ he /♀️ she} can ask for help from the most reliable of all Heroic Spirits.</p><p><strong>Narration:</strong><br> Working alongside Master, surely they could design a program to free the Huwawas</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Now don&#39;t go bringing in trouble while praising me to high heaven, you great fool.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> I don&#39;t accept compliments from just anyone. I&#39;ll be damned if I have to suffer through my friend putting me on a pedestal without so much as a stiff drink.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> Between you and Kingu, I could swear your successors are deliberately trying to work me into an early grave.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Hey there, Uncooked Bean Sprout.<br> Guess you&#39;re no worse for wear after all.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Where am I...?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You got blown pretty far away. Though I guess that ain&#39;t no surprise, seein&#39; how huge that explosion was.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What about Huwawa–the guardian of the forest?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> She&#39;s all gone.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> A ton of swords and spears and stuff came swoopin&#39; in from the side and blasted you and her to kingdom come.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...I see. Good. The important thing is that she&#39;s gone.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That stuff you asked me earlier was about her, wasn&#39;t it?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes, it was. I hope I haven&#39;t offended you again.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I dunno if Master or Mash caught on to it, but you better believe I could tell.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That was the same kind of spell my old lady used.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Dammit... How many kids got mixed together to make that thing?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I counted two thousand eight hundred and ninety-one consciousnesses...though only one of them had retained their sanity.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I ain&#39;t gonna ask what that thing was. Frankly, I don&#39;t wanna know. Not even if it was made the same way as me.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Look. If you think any kinda answers from me to your questions could possibly give those kids anything like salvation...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> ...then boy have you got the wrong damn idea.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> What do you mean?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> It&#39;s all well and good to offer help to a kid who&#39;s cryin&#39; for it. I&#39;d do the same for any of Britain&#39;s subjects.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But comin&#39; up with answers for &#39;em, or some sorta meaning to their lives, and forcin&#39; it on them whether they want it or not... That ain&#39;t gonna be any damn salvation for &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> If anything, that shit&#39;s more like a curse. I oughta know, seein&#39; how my old lady once put one on me.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> But, you&#39;re–</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> All right, you want answers to your questions? Fine, but listen up &#39;cause I ain&#39;t sayin&#39; this shit twice.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And I&#39;m warnin&#39; you now, I don&#39;t wanna hear a goddamn peep outta you the whole time, so just shut your trap and listen up.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> First off, you were barkin&#39; up the wrong tree right from the start.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> You think I destroyed Britain just like my old lady wanted? Well, you&#39;re wrong.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Granted, I don&#39;t know how it looked from the outside. Maybe my old lady thought that&#39;s what I was doin&#39; too.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But the path I walked as a knight, and the sins I bear for destroying Britain...all that is on me and me alone.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I was the one who wanted to be the next king...<br> and I&#39;m the one who tore the kingdom to shreds.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But I didn&#39;t do any of that &#39;cause someone told me to. I did it all of my own damn volition.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> My birth, my prophecy, my old lady eggin&#39; me on, my old man refusin&#39; me... I&#39;ve accepted it all now.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Yeah, that&#39;s right.<br> Those things are all part of me. I own &#39;em.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And I&#39;ll be damned if I let anyone write &#39;em off by sayin&#39; I was just made that way.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Sayin&#39; I only did those things &#39;cause I was created to do &#39;em is an insult to me, and the kingdom I destroyed.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> That&#39;s why I tried to kill you.<br> And I&#39;d do it again if I had the chance.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> I don&#39;t know if these kids you&#39;re tryin&#39; ta save are the same as me. Maybe they are, maybe they aren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> But goin&#39; around foistin&#39; your own idea of salvation on &#39;em whether they asked you to or not ain&#39;t any better than the kinda shit those god assholes always pulled.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...Yes. I think...you might be right.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Trust me, you&#39;re overthinkin&#39; this. For the moment, all you gotta do&#39;s kill whoever did this to those kids.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Even if they&#39;re ancient gods?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Way easier than goin&#39; up against my old man, am I right?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Anyway, that&#39;s all I got.<br> Well? Got a problem with that?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...No. Not at all.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> The only things I have for you are an apology and gratitude.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I see now that I was in a rush to find something that could help.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I think I was hoping to find as many clues as I possibly could to bring back to the Throne before we have to leave Chaldea in a few days...</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...even though I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll retain these memories the next time I&#39;m summoned.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> At any rate...I think what you just told me could turn out to be key.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Again, I&#39;m truly sorry for saying something that made you feel like I was making light of your life.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;ll make sure to revise the data I have on you.<br> Thank you again, Sir Mordred.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Tch... Don&#39;t say all that shit out loud, dumbass. Though I guess if you&#39;d kept harpin&#39; on it after all that, I&#39;d&#39;ve just cut ties with you on the spot.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> And while I&#39;d be fine with that myself...Master doesn&#39;t like us doin&#39; that sorta thing, you know?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Shit, I almost forgot! If you tell anyone else what I just told you, well... I won&#39;t cut ties with you, but I will knock you into next week. Got it?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Though, now that I mention it, I think I&#39;ve told Master something similar before...</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Ha, speak of the devil. Here [♂ he /♀️ she} comes now.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Heeey!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Are you two all right?</p><hr><p><strong>Mash:</strong><br> Here they are, Senpai! Thank goodness you&#39;re both all right! Good news! We just got a call from the real Da Vinci!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Hey guys! Glad to see you&#39;re all okay.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Let me cut to the chase:<br> you&#39;re all still in the simulator.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> I knew it!</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Whoa, I&#39;m getting major déjà vu for some reason.</p><hr><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> We lost track of you for a while, but at least we know exactly why this happened. It was the professor&#39;s doing.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> He set it up so that running the exit codes would cause the simulator to recreate a part of ancient Uruk that Sheba once observed.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> This isn&#39;t the first time he&#39;s done this sort of thing, so I thought I was ready for it, but according to Holmes, he apparently had an accomplice this time.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> And since I was expecting the professor to pull something, the fact that a more laid-back, hedonistic personality made this modification caught me off guard.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> It turns out the culprit didn&#39;t just modify the simulator&#39;s own systems; they cast their own illusion on top of it too. They must&#39;ve spent a long time planning this prank.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Luckily, the wisest of all kings happened to pass by, and he managed to eliminate the virus in a flash. Seriously, what&#39;s in that stone tablet of his, and where can I get one for myself?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...!</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Oh, if you&#39;re wondering, he&#39;s not here anymore. He just said something about how he had nothing more to say and left.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Anyway, it&#39;s obvious the professor had some nefarious plan in mind for Enkidu. What would you like to do now? Should I put out an APB and have him arrested?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> No... That&#39;s all right. I&#39;m grateful to whoever did this, regardless of what their intentions may have been.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Now my system data is updated, and a limiter I had placed on me when I was summoned has been released as a result.</p><p><strong>Da Vinci:</strong><br> Really? ...Oh wow, you&#39;re right. Your whole Spirit Origin has changed... No, not changed; evolved. Damn, what the hell happened in there? It&#39;s only been about an hour!</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Well...in human terms, I would say it&#39;s as though a weight has been lifted from my shoulders.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> What, now? Fat lotta good that&#39;s gonna do you when we&#39;re all about to leave.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> There may yet be some significance in my remaining here even after the Incineration of Humanity was averted.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> And in that case, I should try to expand my potential to its fullest, even if it is only for a few days.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> That gave me the space I needed to pour in the power I had before I met Shamhat.</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 1:</strong><br> Huh?</p><hr><p><strong>Fujimaru 2:</strong><br> Does that mean...?</p><hr><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> “Recover the human-fallen child of god, and protect humanity from all manner of threat.”</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I redefined the latter half of my assigned objective. And I did it entirely through my own volition.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Perhaps...this was what whoever caused this disturbance wanted for me all along.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> I&#39;m greatly impressed. It&#39;s as though I&#39;ve been ensnared in an enormous spider web.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Hmm... Sadly, it seems that is all for today&#39;s lecture.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> But I&#39;m glad I succeeded before we&#39;re all dismissed in a few days time.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> This makes it well worth the effort of telling Enkidu those slightly exaggerated things about Mordred.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> What&#39;s that? You don&#39;t see the point in fine-tuning Enkidu any further at this time?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Very well then, let me ask you this.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Is mankind&#39;s existence now secure just because the Demon God Pillars&#39; attempt to incinerate humanity was thwarted?</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> The answer is no! Absolutely not!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> If it was, that blasted detective would have checked out long ago!</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I may not like him, but I do trust his judgment. If he thinks we&#39;re not yet out of the woods, then we almost certainly aren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> And in that case, it&#39;s only right that I do what I can to help.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Evil has its own way of destroying the world. Even if, ironically, Master did prevent my own attempt to do so in Shinjuku.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Conversely, evil also has its own way of saving the world...though not typically through methods that would garner much praise.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> In this case, that method simply happened to involve catching Enkidu in my web.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> They accept mankind&#39;s capacity for good and evil equally, as one would expect from an ancient guardian weapon.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Thus, all I needed to do was have them remember their own sins, and the regret they felt for committing them.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Doing so would provide a shock to their systems; the kind of shock that can be nurtured into emotions and personality.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> I can wait to fully ensnare them until after that&#39;s come to pass. No doubt someone else will be happy to drag their goodness out of them.</p><p><strong>???:</strong><br> ...</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> Looking forward to it that much, are you? Personally, I would rather have nothing to do with you or any other Mephy types, but oh well.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> At this point, it all comes down to whatever happens next.</p><p><strong>Moriarty:</strong><br> While I&#39;m sure our dear Master would prefer to never have to use an Enkidu who&#39;s gone over to evil...I doubt it will be up to [♂ him /♀️ her} to decide.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Man, I&#39;m exhausted after all that blabbing. I&#39;ve always hated lectures, whether I&#39;m giving &#39;em or listening. They&#39;re nothing but a giant pain in the ass.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> So let&#39;s say this was your way of getting me back for tryin&#39; to kill you and call it even.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Anyway, we might as well try to get along, seein&#39; how the end&#39;s almost in sight and shit.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes, good point. While I only have one best friend, I think you would make a perfectly decent ordinary friend.</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Damn, you got some kinda weird thing about always putting your foot in your mouth, don&#39;t you? That&#39;s your whole problem. You know that?</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Then, for the moment...would you and Fran like to continue comparing battle prowess?</p><p><strong>Fran:</strong><br> Uh!?</p><p><strong>Mordred:</strong><br> Really? After all that? Man, for a Lancer,<br> you act a lot like a Berserker.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> Yes... I&#39;d have to agree. I may well end up manifesting as one some day.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> If I do, I hope I can continue to remain on good terms with both you and Master.</p><p><strong>Enkidu:</strong><br> (After all, if I couldn&#39;t control my sanity system...I could inadvertently end up destroying you all.)</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Servants/Interludes/Enkidu.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
