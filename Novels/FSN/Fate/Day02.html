tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-00-morning-in-the-emiya-household" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 00 - Morning in the Emiya household</h2><p>...My awakening is dark.</p><p>Perhaps I just don&#39;t dream much, but unless something really special happens, I always seem to have the same dream.</p><hr><p>...What I imagine are swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why it is, but this is the only thing that comes into my mind.</p><p>There&#39;s no meaning or reason to it.</p><p>It may just be one of the aspects making up Emiya Shirou.</p><hr><p>There are no dreams to dream.</p><p>The only things I recall from sleep are things I was taught a long time ago.</p><p>For example, about magi.</p><p>Even if I&#39;m an amateur, if I&#39;m a magus, it&#39;s only natural for me to understand the kind of world I live in.</p><hr><p>―――To put it simply, a magus is an exception in conflict with modern society.</p><p>But even exceptions must band together to survive.</p><p>Father told me that the group of magi is called the &quot;magecraft Association&quot;.</p><p>...He also said that I shouldn&#39;t associate with them.</p><hr><p>The group called the magecraft Association hides magecraft and organizes magi.</p><p>They basically keep watch to see that magi do not affect society with magecraft, but the strange part is that they do not prohibit misuse of magecraft.</p><hr><p>According to Kiritsugu, the magecraft Association is only interested in the concealment of magecraft.</p><p>Even if a magus carries out his research at the expense of the lives of many ordinary people, the magecraft Association will not punish him.</p><p>Their priority is that magecraft should not become public, so they do not ban magecraft.</p><p>So, they&#39;re crazy people who think you can do anything as long as you don&#39;t get caught.</p><hr><p>Anyway, the surveillance of the magecraft Association is thorough.</p><p>Most magical research would cost the lives of ordinary people, and as a result, the existence of magecraft would become public.</p><p>So, the Association does not allow research that would harm society.</p><hr><p>So magi stay at home and research quietly, while the normal world carries on unmolested.</p><p>Hence, magi only try to hide themselves to escape the Association.</p><p>...So perhaps, I just don&#39;t know it and a magus lives in this town.</p><hr><p>I hear Fuyuki City is a spiritually excellent area.</p><p>Such an area always has a distinguished magus with a history.</p><p>They are called the &quot;Second Owner&quot;, an elite, and the Association entrusts the area to them.</p><p>Magi who would live in the area must visit them and obtain their permission to construct a workshop.</p><hr><p>...Looking at it like that, we&#39;re thieves living here without the permission of the landlord.</p><p>Father was an outlaw who cut his ties with the Association and moved here without the consent of the administrator of Fuyuki.</p><hr><p>The Owner doesn&#39;t know that Emiya Kiritsugu was a magus, and Kiritsugu didn&#39;t know who the Owner was.</p><p>With reasoning like that, I think our position is ambiguous.</p><hr><p>Father, the real magus, has passed away.</p><p>And I, his son and pupil, don&#39;t know the magecraft Association and have not the skill to be a magus.</p><p>...From the Association&#39;s point of view, they would want to catch an amateur like me doing things, but I&#39;ve seen no movement yet.</p><p>No, I&#39;ve heard that Japan is relatively hidden from the eyes of the Association, so I think I&#39;ve just not been found out.</p><hr><p>―――But that doesn&#39;t mean I can let my guard down.</p><p>People say that the eyes of the Association are everywhere. On top of that, if you commit a crime with magecraft, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.</p><p>...That just means that whatever you use magecraft for, lack of care will create enemies.</p><p>I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account――――</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.</p><p>The sun may have just risen as it&#39;s still a bit dark outside.</p><p>&quot;...Hm. I&#39;m really not good in the mornings.&quot;</p><p>I get up, trying not to be defeated by the morning chill, and quickly fold up my futon.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s five thirty.</p><p>One of my strengths is waking up at this time, no matter how late I go to sleep. I do sometimes make mistakes and wake up late like yesterday, but I usually wake up early.</p><p>I think alarm clocks are degenerate, so I haven&#39;t used one since I was a kid.</p><hr><p>&quot;Alright, breakfast...&quot;</p><p>Since I let Sakura do all the work yesterday, I have to return the favor this morning.</p><p>I should finish preparing before Sakura arrives.</p><hr><p>I cook rice and make some miso soup.</p><p>It was radish and carrot yesterday, so I make onion and potato miso soup today.</p><p>I also make the usual broth egg and broth boil, and I&#39;m done.</p><p>I cut and salt the saury, and stop just before cooking it.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right, that should do.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s almost six o&#39;clock.</p><p>I finished earlier than expected, so I have some extra time.</p><p>So, what should I do?</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01-love-s-magical-ranger-force" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01-love-s-magical-ranger-force" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01 - Love`s magical ranger force</h2><p>Unlike Shinto, there&#39;s no one in Miyama City.</p><p>After eight o&#39;clock, there are no people around, and the town is terribly quiet.</p><hr><p>At the junction is the house I saw this morning.</p><p>There&#39;s no sign of people, and the door has a &quot;do not enter&quot; sign.</p><hr><p>...After only one day, the house is as quiet as an abandoned building.</p><p>Parents and older sister killed by the burglar.</p><p>What kind of life remains for the child left behind?</p><hr><p>&quot;――――&quot;</p><p>I bite my lip, feeling powerless.</p><p>Even after swearing to become like Kiritsugu, I can&#39;t do anything about something that happened so close by.</p><p>Even though I want to help someone, in the end, I don&#39;t even know what I can do.</p><hr><p>I climb the hill and reach the Emiya house.</p><p>The lights are still on, so Sakura or Fuji-Nee must still be there.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m home... Oh, just you, Fuji-Nee?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Oh, welcome home, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee turns around, munching on a rice cracker.</p><p>The TV shows a loud variety show.</p><hr><p>&quot;Geez, coming home at a time like this again... I told you to come home early since it gets dark early in the winter.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I am home early. I&#39;m taking part-time jobs that finish at eight, so don&#39;t be so unreasonable.</p><p>...So, where&#39;s Sakura? It looks like dinner&#39;s ready, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura-chan went home early. She said she had something to do today, so she just cooked dinner and left.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee says so happily.</p><p>As far as she&#39;s concerned, anyone who cooks for her is a good person.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. That might be a good idea for a while. It&#39;s been dangerous recently, so maybe I should just cook dinner myself until next term.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I protest! You come home so late, Shirou. If you don&#39;t cook until after that, we won&#39;t eat until after ten.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hold on. Can&#39;t you just eat at home?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? I am at home.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee seems puzzled.</p><p>Honestly, I&#39;m not sure if that makes me happy or sad.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Alright, I understand. I can&#39;t exactly expect you to cook for yourself, can I?</p><p>...Anyways, what&#39;s that thing by your feet? Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve been picking up junk again.&quot;</p><hr><p>Fuji-Nee has a terrible habit of leaving junk at my place.</p><p>Large bowls from restaurants, a heavy teapot she got in the shopping district, a strange guitar that plays by itself... I think she thinks of this place as some kind of a warehouse.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let me see. I&#39;ll throw it away if it&#39;s junk.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This? Uh, it&#39;s a poster that was left over at my place....&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee hands me the poster.</p><p>It&#39;s probably some infamous idol or something.</p><hr><p>&quot;Let&#39;s see...&quot;</p><p>Here we have, a military-style guy with his thumbs up, on a cheap looking blue sky background.</p><p>In letters like blood, it reads:</p><p>&quot;Love&#39;s Lovely Ranger Land.</p><p>Please join the Self-Defense Force&quot;[r]</p><p>...Hold on, this is an army recruiting poster...!</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t want it, so you can have it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Whoa, I don&#39;t want this either!&quot;</p><p>I roll up the poster and hit Fuji-Nee with it.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heheh, missed.&quot;</p><p>But.</p><p>Fuji-Nee deflects my attack with a poster she had hidden, and counterattacks mercilessly.</p><p>Bam.</p><p>The poster lightly knocks my――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Guhhh!?&quot;</p><p>Stars! I saw stars!</p><hr><p>&quot;Heheh, don&#39;t imagine you can hit me with your skills. You need to practice more.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guh... t-that&#39;s not the problem. What was that? Why does a poster make a crash like that...?&quot;</p><p>Could this be the skill of a master...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, sorry, this poster is the special first edition made from steel plate.</p><p>...Shirou, is your head all right...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Fuji-Nee, your personality is going to kill someone one day...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hehe. I&#39;m not worried. Shirou would marry me if that happened.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh, I completely refuse. I have no intention of marrying such a thoughtless killer.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey... I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that dangerous of a person.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I knew it. So it&#39;s true that people never know themselves.&quot;</p><p>How true, how true.</p><p>I&#39;ll have to watch out or I&#39;ll be killed.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh, just keep saying that. Anyways, I&#39;m hungry, Shirou. I&#39;ve waited all this time, so let&#39;s have dinner.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee stands up.</p><p>...How strange. Fuji-Nee is helping out (even if it&#39;s only setting up the dishes). She must be really hungry.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay. Then you can get the dishes out. You can pour rice, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can. Hey, Shirou, can I use a bowl?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess so. Sakura isn&#39;t here today, so there&#39;ll be some left over anyway.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. I&#39;ll use the same for you, then.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee pours rice into two bowls.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Oh well. I was going to have seconds anyway. And besides, if I argue with Fuji-Nee, she&#39;ll take my dinner away.</p><p>And to add...</p><p>Chaotic dinners like this have been common scenes for many years now.</p><hr><p>...The day ends.</p><p>Finishing a rowdy dinner and seeing Fuji-Nee off, I take a bath.</p><p>After that, I practice my daily routine in the shed.</p><p>I complete it as usual and go to sleep.</p><p>It is one in the morning.</p><p>The day ends peacefully without any troubles.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-03-signs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-03-signs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 03 - Signs</h2><p>&quot;Yeah. I have time, so I&#39;ll make something else.&quot;</p><p>I open the refrigerator.</p><p>All that&#39;s left are some cucumber and potatoes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmmm. I could cut and salt the cucumber, or cut the potatoes and serve them vinegared....&quot;</p><p>But those are both things I could do in a couple of minutes, and they&#39;re better fresh.</p><p>It&#39;ll be half an hour until Fuji-Nee and Sakura arrive, so I should make a dish right before they get here.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hmph.&quot;</p><p>In that case, this is free time I can&#39;t make much use of.</p><p>Is there anything I can do in thirty minutes...?</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s some chicken, so...&quot;</p><p>I could cook some bite-sized meat rolls with vegetables, or something like that.</p><hr><p>I cut the meat and tenderize it.</p><p>At a glance, the meat tenderizer is really evil. It&#39;s like a hammer, but it&#39;s flat on four sides and has lots of spikes coming out of it.</p><hr><p>If it were bigger, it would make a great instrument of torture.</p><p>I flatten the meat with the scary object, put some carrots and kidney beans on it, roll it up, cook it in the pan, and steam it with wine.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Huh!? Hold on, what am I doing...!?&quot;</p><p>At that point, I regain my sanity.</p><p>I was trying to make a side dish, as the saury was already the main dish.</p><p>So what am I doing, making another main dish...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;...Honestly. I must have let my guard down, cooking just to pass the time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Eh? You were cooking just to pass the time, Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. The thing is, I was trying to make a side dish. But before I realized it, I was using the knife. Well, I guess habit is a scary thing... of course, that&#39;s just an excuse.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But isn&#39;t that alright? It&#39;s a bit big for breakfast, but since you made it, I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be any leftovers.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You think so? No, that&#39;s not the problem.</p><p>There&#39;s no need for two suns in the sky. I&#39;ll have to ask one of them to leave.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What!? You&#39;re not going to eat it, Senpai?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I will. I wasn&#39;t planning to, but I&#39;ll pack lunch today. That way, it won&#39;t be a waste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow... Senpai, you&#39;re going to make lunch right now?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;ll be close, but I think I can at least get my―――&quot;</p><hr><p>And then.</p><p>I finally realize someone&#39;s behind me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Senpai. I&#39;m here again today.&quot;</p><p>Sakura greets me with a smile.</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for Sakura to come into the kitchen at this time.</p><p>She always rings the bell as she comes in, but sometimes I don&#39;t notice, like this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;G-Good morning, Sakura. Breakfast&#39;s ready, so you can relax in the living room. There&#39;s some tea there.&quot;</p><p>I answer her, staring at the frying pan.</p><p>On the table is a pot of hot water, a teapot, and some snacks.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, yes. You&#39;re perfect again today, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>Sakura&#39;s voice is lively, as if she&#39;s happy about something.</p><p>...And Sakura comes into the kitchen instead of going to the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai? You&#39;re making lunch, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm? Yeah, it turned out that way. It&#39;s a good dish for lunch, so I thought I&#39;d make some side dishes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, then can I help? I&#39;ll make my own, so...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, wait. If you don&#39;t mind having the same thing, I can give you some of mine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Yes. I was watching and I wanted to have some of yours.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right. Can you cook the rice, then? We don&#39;t have enough for two. There should be a fast rice cooker over there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll take care of it. I&#39;ll go and start that, then.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hear the sound of her footsteps, and of her tying her apron.</p><p>&quot;Senpai? We&#39;re okay with two cups of rice, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm, I think that&#39;ll be enough.&quot;</p><p>With quick movements, Sakura comes to help in the kitchen.</p><hr><p>&quot;Morning! Well done, it smells great!&quot;</p><p>A little past six-thirty.</p><p>Thirty minutes after Sakura, Fuji-Nee arrives as usual.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good morning, Sensei. Please wait a little longer for breakfast.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yep, I&#39;ll wait. ...Oh, Sakura-chan, are you making breakfast with Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, Senpai made breakfast on his own. We&#39;re making lunch right now.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura&#39;s voice is really lively.</p><p>We&#39;re not doing anything particularly fun, so I don&#39;t know what she&#39;s so happy about.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, so of course you&#39;re in a good mood. Cooking and Shirou, so much fun stuff. Okay, we don&#39;t have much time, but take it easy.&quot;</p><p>Laughing, Fuji-Nee sits at the table and pours some tea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Geez, she must still be off dreaming. What&#39;s so fun about cooking for school?&quot;</p><p>I put the pan back onto the rack.</p><p>The food&#39;s made, so all that&#39;s left is to pack the lunchboxes.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, Sakura. I made you do extra work before club activities.</p><p>I wanted you to relax since you did a lot yesterday.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Don&#39;t worry about that at all. Like Fujimura-Sensei said, I find cooking fun.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>Well, I know she likes cooking... but still, it must be hard for her getting up at five o&#39;clock to make lunch.</p><p>Besides, Sakura comes and makes dinner often.</p><p>So if I&#39;m getting her to cook in the mornings too, she might have no free time at all.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew. I&#39;m grateful for the help, but you should relax, Sakura. You should sleep in during the mornings, and after school is for playing around. You don&#39;t have to come and help around my house.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I am relaxing. You made breakfast today, and I got some food from you for lunch too.&quot;</p><hr><p>She smiles.</p><p>...Sigh.</p><p>It&#39;s been a year and a half since Sakura started to help out. Now, she keeps coming back like this no matter what I say.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s different. You have your own life too, so you can&#39;t just take care of me and Fuji-Nee. If you&#39;re taking care of us, you won&#39;t be able to do all the things you want to.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahaha, that&#39;s fine. My only hobbies are archery and cooking. In fact, my goal is to beat you at cooking, and I think I&#39;m almost there.&quot;</p><p>Sakura puffs her chest out boastfully.</p><p>...Gah.</p><p>I want to argue back, but it&#39;s true as she is about to beat me.</p><hr><p>&quot;So please don&#39;t worry about it. I like cooking here, and improving is fun.</p><p>I&#39;m helping you to pay you back for showing me this great pleasure, and for my own benefit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. Does that mean you&#39;re stealing some of my skill every day, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I improve quickly just by helping you. So please be ready. I&#39;ll make you admit defeat someday.&quot;</p><p>Whoa.</p><p>I can&#39;t believe she said it so bluntly!</p><hr><p>&quot;...Man. If I&#39;d known this was coming, I would never have taught you to cook. You never even heard of oil before coming here, but now you&#39;re after me like an enemy. Really, why are you chasing me like this?</p><p>Can&#39;t you just be happy making food?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I&#39;m after you. You can&#39;t be better than me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s so bad about that, but we should start setting the table for breakfast.</p><hr><p>&quot;Alrighty.&quot;</p><p>I check the saury.</p><p>Placing my chopstick on the well grilled stomach, I check how cooked it is.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess that&#39;s done. Here, Sakura, can you take this to the table?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, thank you Senpai.&quot;</p><hr><p>I hand the plate of saury to Sakura.</p><p>Then, as if remembering something important, Sakura stops dead.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sakura? What&#39;s wrong, did you leave something at home?&quot;</p><p>Sakura may seem shrewd, but she actually forgets things a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for her to remember something and stop like this.</p><p>But... it seems like that&#39;s not the case this morning.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no answer.</p><p>She just blankly stares at my hand like she&#39;s still in a daze, then...</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai... what&#39;s that bruise on your hand?&quot;</p><p>She asks me a strange question.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>I look down at the hand she&#39;s talking about.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...? You&#39;re right, there is a bruise. That&#39;s weird, I don&#39;t remember hitting it anywhere.&quot;</p><hr><p>For some reason, there&#39;s a big bruise on the back of my left hand.</p><p>It&#39;s quite an impressive welt, and it looks like it came from some sort of a cut.</p><p>Even on my own hand, it looks bad.</p><p>Perhaps Sakura&#39;s not feeling well as she&#39;s very quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;Sorry, can you handle the rest? I&#39;ll go put something on it.&quot;</p><p>I let Sakura take care of the kitchen and head for the dojo.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if I did this during my sleep, but I&#39;ll have to treat it.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But for some reason, I&#39;m worried about Sakura, who looked awkward and downcast.</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;ll go on ahead, then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sakura, are you sure you&#39;re all right? You can skip your club if you&#39;re not feeling well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m fine. It&#39;s just a light headache, so you shouldn&#39;t worry about it. I only look bad because you imagine it. I&#39;m doing really well today.&quot;</p><p>She says so with a smile.</p><p>...But anyone can tell she&#39;s just bluffing.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Really well, huh? Even though you couldn&#39;t eat any breakfast?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh....&quot;</p><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>Without looking up, she replies...</p><p>&quot;...Please excuse me. You&#39;re the one who should be resting, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>With those words, she leaves.</p><hr><p>The table is cleared.</p><p>But on the plate in the kitchen, Sakura&#39;s meal remains untouched.</p><hr><p>&quot;Honestly, what&#39;s wrong with her?&quot;</p><p>She had been in such a good mood, but after seeing my bruise, Sakura suddenly became quiet and started to make lots of mistakes.</p><hr><p>She overfilled the tea, drenched the omelets with soy sauce, and sat down at the table with her apron on.</p><p>And on top of that, she ate nothing and went to school looking pale.</p><hr><p>&quot;Maybe she caught a cold or something.&quot;</p><p>I mutter to myself while cleaning up.</p><p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve seen Sakura like this.</p><p>I got to know her during the summer four years ago, and she started coming here to help a year and a half ago.</p><p>In that time, I&#39;ve never seen her look this ill.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Fuji-Nee will be at the archery range, so I don&#39;t think there&#39;ll be a problem there. But I should go and check on her after school or sometime...</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04-tohsaka-rin-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04-tohsaka-rin-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04 - Tohsaka Rin(I)</h2><p>Twenty minutes after taking the bus from my school, I arrive at the neighboring town of Shinto across the bridge.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, it&#39;s not five o&#39;clock yet? I guess I still have some time.&quot;</p><p>Miyama City is a residential district, so it&#39;s hard to find part-time jobs there, but the developing Shinto has many available.</p><p>The school rules allow for part-time jobs, so I work a few easy ones.</p><hr><p>Within them, I prefer hard physical labor that ends as quickly as possible.</p><p>It&#39;s killing two birds with one stone, as it builds my body while I get paid for it.</p><hr><p>Today&#39;s job is a simple loading job from five to eight o&#39;clock.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s only three hours, there&#39;s six hours worth of work to do. They make you run around without a minute&#39;s rest.</p><hr><p>So I should rest when I can, even if it&#39;s just for ten minutes.</p><p>It&#39;s a waste of energy walking around until my job, so I guess I&#39;ll rest in the park.</p><hr><p>This park among the buildings is like a big field.</p><p>A park should be filled with people like families and lovers on weekends, but it&#39;s empty here now.</p><p>No... this place is always desolate.</p><hr><p>&quot;This place is the same as always.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m a bit sad.</p><p>The utterly neglected ground looks awful compared to the neatly organized surroundings.</p><p>The desolate area makes the wind feel cold.</p><p>This is the remains of the conflagration ten years ago, and this is the place where I was saved from burning to death.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why they don&#39;t plant grass here. It&#39;s a waste to keep it like this.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.</p><p>Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I stare at the burned land to pass the time.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember what happened here back then.</p><p>I probably don&#39;t remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn&#39;t have been an easy scene to memorize.</p><p>All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p><p>And that people died trying to save others.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why....&quot;</p><p>For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.</p><p>For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.</p><p>For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.</p><hr><p>And for example...</p><p>People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn&#39;t even know.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t like things like that.</p><p>It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.</p><p>Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?</p><p>All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn&#39;t I manage such a simple thing?</p><hr><p>&#39;That&#39;s difficult. What you want is to save everyone.&#39;</p><hr><p>Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.</p><p>Of course, as a child, I denied it.</p><p>Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.</p><p>I knew he was a superhero who couldn&#39;t ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.</p><p>So I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.</p><hr><p>When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.</p><hr><p>&#39;Shirou, saving one person means not saving others. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It&#39;s obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.&#39;</p><hr><p>I understand that.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious, now that he&#39;s said it.</p><p>Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.</p><p>With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.</p><hr><p>Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn&#39;t saved.</p><p>That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.</p><p>The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.</p><p>That&#39;s why even God cannot save everyone.</p><hr><p>&quot;All the more so if it&#39;s a natural disaster. No one could have saved everybody.&quot;</p><p>The fire ten years ago was like that.</p><p>It&#39;s not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t want that.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t want such a thing.</p><p>I don&#39;t want help that has a limited capacity.</p><p>You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.</p><p>I can&#39;t stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.</p><hr><p>So if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...</p><p>&quot;I would certainly have died in vain.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s for certain.</p><p>Geez, I&#39;m hopeless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah, it&#39;s five o&#39;clock already.&quot;</p><p>The five o&#39;clock bell rings.</p><p>I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.</p><hr><p>When my job&#39;s done, the sun has already set.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit before eight.</p><p>I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.</p><p>It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.</p><hr><p>Here in front of the station, the night&#39;s just getting started.</p><p>There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.</p><p>The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I&#39;m watching a grand festival of illumination.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I don&#39;t have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>I walk while looking up at the lighted building.</p><p>It&#39;s the biggest building in Shinto, so I can&#39;t see the top clearly.</p><p>I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night&#39;s scenery...</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...When I think I see something out of place.</p><hr><p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>I stop and stare at the rooftop.</p><p>I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What the...&quot;</p><p>It looks like someone I know.</p><hr><p>Why is she there?</p><p>What would she be doing there?</p><p>With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she notices me down here.</p><p>No, there&#39;s no way she could see me.</p><p>She&#39;s so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.</p><p>I can recognize her since she&#39;s standing there alone, but there&#39;s no way she would notice me down here among all these people.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s just looking down at the town.</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.</p><p>She is on top of a tall tower.</p><p>She&#39;s like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>And then.</p><p>She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.</p><p>Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.</p><p>&quot;That was Tohsaka, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have no proof, but I think I&#39;m right.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I&#39;m not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.

He does teach very harshly, but he&#39;s not the type to make fun of people like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m surprised. You really are like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm, what do you mean by that? Were you just thinking badly of me?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, I was just thinking objectively about the truth. So it&#39;s up to you if you want to feel angry about it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Stop copying me.[l]</p><p>Fine, but what about Shinji? Why did he act like that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm, from what I heard, it was something like getting turned down harshly by Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You mean, that Tohsaka?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;There&#39;s no other Tohsaka at our school.[l]</p><p>I&#39;m talking about the honor student in class 2-A, Miss Perfect, Tohsaka Rin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard that nickname before.&quot;</p><hr><p>It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve heard the nickname, but I would probably agree with it.</p><p>With Tohsaka involved, I can understand even Shinji getting turned down, and most of all...</p><p>If it was Tohsaka, I can see her refusing him mercilessly.</p><hr><p>&quot;Anyways, Shinji&#39;s been like this since yesterday.</p><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;ve had to keep an eye on the dojo until now today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shinji has a nasty temper. I know it&#39;s hard, but keep up the hard work, Mitsuzuri.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, okay. But Shinji never knows when to stop, you know? I feel like he&#39;ll do something really bad if he asks her out again and gets turned down again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, even Shinji wouldn&#39;t approach someone who turned him down. He&#39;s pretty good about that kind of thing.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But he can&#39;t help it if the person who turned him down comes near him. I don&#39;t know why, but Tohsaka comes and visits the dojo pretty often. You quit, so you wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s the first I&#39;ve heard of it.</p><p>Tohsaka Rin doesn&#39;t do any club activities for personal reasons. I thought she went straight home since she even turned down the recommendation to join the student council.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, maybe that sort of thing is good every now and then. He has a haughty attitude, so it might be good for him to have a hard time for once.&quot;</p><p>Mitsuzuri says some dangerous things.</p><p>...Come to think of it, I heard that Tohsaka has many enemies. Could Mitsuzuri be one of them?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey Mitsuzuri, that&#39;s going too...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, it&#39;s almost time. Bye Emiya, come and see my archery skills sometime.&quot;</p><p>Mitsuzuri hurries off.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――She&#39;s just like always.&quot;</p><p>But I like that part of her.</p><p>Feeling calmer now, I head for the classroom.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s lunchtime.</p><p>Our school has a splendid cafeteria and most students eat there.</p><p>But there are some old-fashioned students who bring their own lunches. Two of them happen to be me and the student council president in front of me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Emiya, could you give me some of that fried chicken? My lunch is desperately lacking in meat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure, but why is your lunch so plain? You live in a temple, but there aren&#39;t any teachings prohibiting meat or alcohol, right?”</p><hr><p>&quot;Such an anachronism. It&#39;s just my father&#39;s way.</p><p>He says there&#39;s no luxurious foods for a young priest, and that I should have to work for what I want. I&#39;m thinking of running away and joining the circus.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, yeah, that sounds like that guy.&quot;</p><hr><p>Issei&#39;s father is the priest of the Ryuudou Temple, and a bold guy who&#39;s old friends with the old man at Fuji-Nee&#39;s place.</p><p>You can&#39;t expect a normal personality when he&#39;s friends with a guy like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s great. Well then, I&#39;ll give you one in the hope of repayment someday.&quot;</p><p>I hand him my lunchbox.</p><p>&quot;Thank you. This too is part of my religious training.&quot;</p><p>Issei bows deeply.</p><p>...How can I put this? I never know what to say when things like this remind me that he&#39;s the son of a priest.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Emiya. Did you know there was something going on around the 2nd avenue? It&#39;s right around the intersection where we part.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Intersection...?&quot;</p><p>The intersection this morning... he must mean that clamor with all the police cars.</p><hr><p>&quot;I heard there was a murder. I don&#39;t know the details, but of the family of four, only the child survived. They say the older sister and the parents were stabbed to death. But what&#39;s strange is that they think the weapon was a long one, not like a knife or something.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>A long weapon? He must mean something like a sword.</p><p>It was a murder... so that must mean the sister and the parents were killed.</p><hr><p>...I picture it.</p><p>Someone barging in during the night. Unjust violence. A one-sided pillage like an accident. Slashed parents. The sister killed without even knowing what&#39;s going on. To the side, the child covered in their blood.</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei, have they caught the murderer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t seem like it. Accidents from faulty construction in Shinto, and murder here. It&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re making the curfew here at school ear―――what&#39;s wrong, Emiya? Did you choke on something?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? Nothing, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No... I was just surprised since you had a nasty expression. Sorry, this wasn&#39;t something I should have talked about during lunch.”</p><hr><p>Issei tries to soften the air apologetically.</p><p>...I was fine with the topic, but was I really making such a nasty face?</p><hr><p>And then, there&#39;s a quiet knock at the door.</p><p>&quot;Excuse me, is Ryuudou here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Oh, what is it, Sensei?&quot;</p><p>Issei addresses Kuzuki, who just entered.</p><p>It must be a simple talk about the student council as Issei seems pretty relaxed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s not something you see everyday.</p><p>Despite his appearance, Issei&#39;s very shy. The guy who draws a line against his classmates and even his teachers is letting his guard down with Kuzuki.</p><hr><p>&quot;Maybe they get along because they&#39;re both so serious.&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou, the teacher in charge of class 2-A, is serious and stubborn.</p><p>Probably that aspect helps him get along with Issei, who prizes order and discipline.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The two continue to talk.</p><p>All the while, I can&#39;t get the story of the murder out of my head.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-08-tohsaka-rin-i" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-08-tohsaka-rin-i" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 08 - Tohsaka Rin(I)</h2><p>I&#39;m worried about the conversation I had this morning, so I&#39;ve made my way to the archery club before I knew it.</p><p>&quot;Geez, what am I doing?&quot;</p><p>According to Mitsuzuri, Tohsaka Rin comes here often.</p><p>Well, I really don&#39;t care about that, but I know that Shinji getting angry at her is going to be a problem.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Shinji just doesn&#39;t stop when he gets angry....&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s bad if Shinji gets violent just because she turned him down.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s bad, it&#39;s just bad.</p><p>It makes me feel bad just thinking about it, so I have to stop it from happening.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, Tohsaka&#39;s not here.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka isn&#39;t around. Mitsuzuri&#39;s worries were needless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, who&#39;s not here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!!&quot;</p><p>I spin around.</p><hr><p>&quot;So... who&#39;s not here?&quot;</p><p>And there&#39;s Issei, whom I just left behind.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, i-it&#39;s you, Issei. Don&#39;t scare me like that.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, you were looking at the dojo suspiciously.</p><p>So, who&#39;s not there?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Tohsaka. I heard that she had an argument with Shinji yesterday, so I came to see how things were.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh wow, that is suspicious. You gave your reasons without being asked. I only asked you who wasn&#39;t here.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...! W-What? What I do shouldn&#39;t concern you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. But it&#39;s useless, Emiya. Tohsaka won&#39;t be here. That&#39;s because she intentionally skipped school today.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>Skipped school... so, she was absent today?</p><hr><p>&quot;I see, she&#39;s absent... wait, Issei. How can you say she skipped school? I don&#39;t think she&#39;d do such a thing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course she will. She won&#39;t catch a cold. As I see it, she&#39;s evil. You&#39;ll be eaten if you let her looks deceive you, Emiya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm.&quot;</p><p>Somehow, Issei&#39;s words annoy me.</p><p>It&#39;s true that I don&#39;t know her, but I can&#39;t imagine that she&#39;s a bad person.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re going too far, Issei. Tohsaka can&#39;t be like that.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hmm? What, you&#39;re after Tohsaka too? Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Please ignore what I just said.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...!&quot;</p><p>A-After Tohsaka!? Who said anything like that!?</p><hr><p>&quot;D-Don&#39;t jump to conclusions! I just thought it&#39;d be bad if Shinji got into trouble again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;So you were planning to stop Shinji if he attacked Tohsaka, huh? You&#39;re playing an unrewarded role again. ...I don&#39;t really care, but you have a bad taste, Emiya.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s not unrewarded since I haven&#39;t done it. But Issei, didn&#39;t you say something strange?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You mean that going after Tohsaka is in bad taste?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Tohsaka is really popular. I haven&#39;t heard any bad rumors about her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, none. And that&#39;s exactly what I don&#39;t like about it.&quot;</p><p>Issei looks away, snorting.</p><hr><p>&quot;What don&#39;t you like about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Everything. The woman is a fox, a schoolgirl, a monster. I just don&#39;t like her physiologically. I won&#39;t say anything bad, but you should try to hate her too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Issei, don&#39;t you always say we shouldn&#39;t talk badly of people behind their backs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Idiot, this doesn&#39;t count as talking behind their back. I&#39;m speaking so that she can hear it.&quot;</p><hr><p>Ah, no wonder I feel someone&#39;s eyes from the archery dojo.</p><p>...Thank God.</p><p>I&#39;m so glad Tohsaka is absent today.</p><hr><p>&quot;Please, Issei. Please restrict yourself to talking behind people&#39;s backs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;All right, if you say so.</p><p>But I wasn&#39;t insulting her at all. I was only saying that I&#39;m on guard against her. That should be within my rights.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But you were saying things like monster and fox...&quot;</p><p>...And I think the term schoolgirl is discrimination.</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that was just praise. There are good foxes and monsters too.</p><p>I only applied the terms to describe Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Katsu.&quot;</p><p>Issei laughs.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll be going. I&#39;m going back to the student council room, but you&#39;re going to work, right? You shouldn&#39;t have time to play around like this.&quot;</p><hr><p>He must feel refreshed now that he&#39;s said everything he wanted, as he leaves calmly.</p><p>I&#39;ve known him for 2 years now, but I still don&#39;t understand his personality.</p><hr><p>Twenty minutes after taking the bus from my school, I arrive at the neighboring town of Shinto across the bridge.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh, it&#39;s not five o&#39;clock yet? I guess I still have some time.&quot;</p><p>Miyama City is a residential district, so it&#39;s hard to find part-time jobs there, but the developing Shinto has many available.</p><p>The school rules allow for part-time jobs, so I work a few easy ones.</p><hr><p>Within them, I prefer hard physical labor that ends as quickly as possible.</p><p>It&#39;s killing two birds with one stone, as it builds my body while I get paid for it.</p><hr><p>Today&#39;s job is a simple loading job from five to eight o&#39;clock.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s only three hours, there&#39;s six hours worth of work to do. They make you run around without a minute&#39;s rest.</p><hr><p>So I should rest when I can, even if it&#39;s just for ten minutes.</p><p>It&#39;s a waste of energy walking around until my job, so I guess I&#39;ll rest in the park.</p><hr><p>This park among the buildings is like a big field.</p><p>A park should be filled with people like families and lovers on weekends, but it&#39;s empty here now.</p><p>No... this place is always desolate.</p><hr><p>&quot;This place is the same as always.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m a bit sad.</p><p>The utterly neglected ground looks awful compared to the neatly organized surroundings.</p><p>The desolate area makes the wind feel cold.</p><p>This is the remains of the conflagration ten years ago, and this is the place where I was saved from burning to death.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why they don&#39;t plant grass here. It&#39;s a waste to keep it like this.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a large area, so if they retiled it, the park would get bigger.</p><p>Thinking absent-mindedly, I sit down on a bench.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I stare at the burned land to pass the time.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember what happened here back then.</p><p>I probably don&#39;t remember because I was a kid, and it wouldn&#39;t have been an easy scene to memorize.</p><p>All I can remember is that it was hot and I couldn&#39;t breathe.</p><p>And that people died trying to save others.</p><hr><p>&quot;I wonder why....&quot;</p><p>For example, an adult that tried to save a child from a burning house. He saved the child, but died in its place.</p><p>For example, there were people who had their throats burned, but they gave what little water they had to one guy, and the others died.</p><p>For example, there was someone who ran alone to get away from the fire as fast as possible, and everyone that he passed on the way died.</p><hr><p>And for example...</p><p>People who died because they gave away something that was saving them, only to save others they didn&#39;t even know.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I didn&#39;t like things like that.</p><p>It makes me mad that those who tried hard were sacrificed.</p><p>Am I greedy to want an ending where everybody is safe and happy?</p><p>All I wanted was to see people relax peacefully, so why couldn&#39;t I manage such a simple thing?</p><hr><p>&#39;That&#39;s difficult. What you want is to save everyone.&#39;</p><hr><p>Kiritsugu answered so to the question I asked as a child.</p><p>Of course, as a child, I denied it.</p><p>Because Kiritsugu saved me. I knew he was a sorcerer who could do anything.</p><p>I knew he was a superhero who couldn&#39;t ignore people in need, who saved them for no benefit.</p><p>So, I believed Kiritsugu could have saved everyone back then.</p><hr><p>When I told him that, he made a troubled expression and said something that I remember to this day.</p><hr><p>&#39;Shirou, saving one person means not saving another. Look, a superhero can only save the people he has saved. It&#39;s obvious, but that is the definition of a superhero.&#39;</p><hr><p>I understand that.</p><p>It&#39;s obvious, now that he&#39;s said it.</p><p>Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a robber and some hostages, and the robber intends to kill the hostages.</p><p>With normal methods, most of the hostages will be killed.</p><hr><p>Even if you use a miraculous method to save all the hostages, there will still be one person who isn&#39;t saved.</p><p>That, of course, is the robber whose hostages were rescued.</p><p>The people a superhero saves are only those he decides to save.</p><p>That&#39;s why even God cannot save everyone.</p><hr><p>&quot;All the more so if it&#39;s a natural disaster. No one could have saved everyone.&quot;</p><p>The fire ten years ago was like that.</p><p>It&#39;s not something I, who was miraculously saved from it, can talk about now.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I don&#39;t want that.&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t want such a thing.</p><p>I don&#39;t want help that has a limited capacity.</p><p>You have to help, no matter how impossible it is.</p><p>I can&#39;t stand to have strangers dying around me like back then.</p><hr><p>So, if I had been there ten years ago, even if it was impossible, I would have gone into the fire and...</p><p>&quot;I would certainly have died in vain.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s for certain.</p><p>Geez, I&#39;m hopeless.</p><hr><p>&quot;Gah, it&#39;s already five o&#39;clock.&quot;</p><p>The five o&#39;clock bell rings.</p><p>I stand up and quickly make my way to my work.</p><hr><p>When my job&#39;s done, the sun has already set.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit before eight.</p><p>I finished ten minutes early because I worked too hard.</p><p>It seems I worked frantically since I went to that place before work.</p><hr><p>Here in front of the station, the night&#39;s just getting started.</p><p>There are lots of people, and a constant flow of cars on the road.</p><p>The buildings are still lit up, and just looking at them makes me feel like I&#39;m watching a grand festival of illumination.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess I don&#39;t have to buy anything for Fuji-Nee.&quot;</p><p>I walk while looking up at the lighted building.</p><p>It&#39;s the biggest building in Shinto, so I can&#39;t see the top clearly.</p><p>I just gaze up the building, just enjoying the night&#39;s scenery...</p><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>...When I think I see something out of place.</p><hr><p>&quot;What was that?&quot;</p><p>I stop and stare at the rooftop.</p><p>I focus my eyes, looking at the thing as small as a grain of rice.</p><hr><p>&quot;...What the...&quot;</p><p>It looks like someone I know.</p><hr><p>Why is she there?</p><p>What would she be doing there?</p><p>With her long hair fluttering and doing nothing, she looks down at the town.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she notices me down here.</p><p>No, there&#39;s no way she could see me.</p><p>She&#39;s so high up that I, with better eyesight than most, can barely see her by improving my vision with magical energy.</p><p>I can recognize her since she&#39;s standing there alone, but there&#39;s no way she would notice me down here among all these people.</p><hr><p>She&#39;s just looking down at the town.</p><p>Maybe she&#39;s looking for something, as I can feel her sharp stare even down here.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I forget about time and keep looking up at the girl standing in the sky.</p><p>She is on top of a tall tower.</p><p>She&#39;s like a witch, looking down at the earth with the moon behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>And then.</p><p>She must be done with whatever she was doing, as she disappears.</p><p>Her figure has disappeared and the scene returns to the beautiful view of the night.</p><p>&quot;That was Tohsaka, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I have no proof, but I think I&#39;m right.</p><p>There aren&#39;t many girls with looks that stand out that much, and more than that, I&#39;m not stupid enough to mistake a girl I secretly admire.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.

There&#39;s no problem unless I run into a teacher in the hallway, so you can wait here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t wait here while you&#39;re doing something dangerous. Senpai, I don&#39;t care about the tea.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not dangerous. Just sit down. Drinking tea in the classroom is a good thing to try once.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><hr><p>I jump out into the hallway.</p><p>The student council room isn&#39;t far away.</p><p>I&#39;ll get the tea set quickly and surprise Sakura.</p><hr><p>...Time passes.</p><p>While we do something silly like drinking tea together in a classroom, we just stare outside.</p><p>Outside the window is a glowing sunset that hurts my eyes.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Sakura stares blankly at the sunset.</p><p>I have nothing to talk about, so I follow Sakura&#39;s example and keep my mouth shut.</p><hr><p>Time passes slowly since we&#39;re not talking.</p><p>Sakura isn&#39;t the talkative type, and she often just stares at the scenery.</p><p>I guess she&#39;s more relaxed by herself.</p><p>Come to think of it, Sakura wants to be alone a lot.</p><p>It&#39;s not like she&#39;s excluding herself from the crowd, but she wants to isolate herself within the crowd. She looks outside the crowd more than in it.</p><hr><p>That must be why she stayed here in the classroom.</p><p>Sakura doesn&#39;t actively try to spend time with others.</p><p>Fuji-Nee and I are special.</p><p>Even I wouldn&#39;t have known her if I hadn&#39;t met Shinji.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>I sneak a glance at Sakura.</p><p>When Shinji introduced me to her 4 years ago, she was just a small girl.</p><p>Now she&#39;s my junior who comes to help around the house, and her childish image is disappearing.</p><hr><p>Sakura has grown beautiful.</p><p>...No, she was beautiful before, but I think she&#39;s become too beautiful as a member of the opposite sex.</p><p>On top of that, she&#39;s thoughtful and gentle.</p><p>With that many good qualities, I can understand her being called beautiful alongside Tohsaka Rin.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>But it&#39;s strange, I don&#39;t understand it.</p><p>Sakura is alone often.</p><p>She doesn&#39;t seem to have any friends in the archery club, and seeing how she&#39;s alone in this classroom, she might not have any friends in her class either.</p><hr><p>...Come to think of it, I only know Sakura from the archery club and from my place.</p><p>I don&#39;t know how she is at school or at home.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>While I think about this, looking up at the red sky...</p><p>&quot;Senpai, do you remember?&quot;</p><p>Looking outside, Sakura asks me a question.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Remember what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It was a long time ago, back before I met you...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, you mean before we knew each other...?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It was four years ago, right when I entered this school.</p><p>I wasn&#39;t used to the school, and I was walking about aimlessly when I saw something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah, I really wonder how it ended up like that.</p><p>Even though it was after school and the track team had left, someone was still running around alone. When I looked closer wondering what he was doing, I realized that he was doing high jumps by himself.&quot;</p><hr><p>A smile.</p><p>It must be a lovely memory, as Sakura is smiling happily.</p><hr><p>&quot;It was a really red sunset. Everything was red and beautiful, but so lonely.</p><p>In it, he just continued to run alone. Running, jumping, dropping the pole, and repeating. There was no one around and he clearly couldn&#39;t jump over it, but he kept on trying.</p><hr><p>&quot;It wasn&#39;t something that could be done with effort. The pole was way over his head.</p><p>Even I could tell that it was impossible, so he must have known as well.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>I understand, but I wonder what she&#39;s talking about.</p><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s strange to see someone practicing even after school.</p><hr><p>&quot;I was a bad girl back then. Something bad had happened to me, and I just wanted to take it out on someone. I wanted to see this person fail, give up, and be discouraged, so I kept watching him.</p><p>But he wouldn&#39;t give up.</p><p>He repeated it over and over, even though it was impossible for him. Not complaining at all for all that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Wow. Maybe he was on the edge? Like the next day was the test, and he wouldn&#39;t get chosen unless he could jump that high?”</p><hr><p>&quot;No, that wasn&#39;t it. He wasn&#39;t on the track team or anything.&quot;</p><p>Oh, I see.</p><p>...Well, that&#39;s fine... But why are you smiling, Sakura?</p><hr><p>&quot;And then, while I was watching him, I realized. He didn&#39;t care about what he was doing. He just happened to run into something he couldn&#39;t do, and he was obstinate about not losing.</p><p>The sun set, and he just cleaned up and went home. He must have been really tired, but he walked away calmly like nothing had happened.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t get it. If he quit, that must mean he jumped over it, right? So how high was it?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ahahaha, well, the thing is, he couldn&#39;t jump over it. He tried for 3 hours, but he was convinced at last that he couldn&#39;t jump over it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Man, that&#39;s some ending.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;He was so earnest that I even worried about him.</p><p>He&#39;s probably someone very dependable.</p><p>But that made me feel uneasy and lonely.&quot;</p><p>Her voice itself sounds so lonely, it seems like it will be swallowed by the red in this room.</p><hr><p>&quot;Okay, I understand the story... But what about it, Sakura?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s okay if you don&#39;t understand. That just means that even though it looked that way to me, it was just an everyday thing for him.&quot;</p><p>Despite her gloomy mood earlier, Sakura smiles sweetly.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>...And then, even though I&#39;m pretty dull, I understand when she puts it like that.</p><p>I don&#39;t remember it myself, but four years ago was right after my father died.</p><p>Back then, I did lots of reckless things, so I guess I did something like that.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Uh, Sakura, so that was...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, he is the senior before me now.</p><p>Back then, he was so small that I thought he was my age.&quot;</p><p>...Ugh.</p><p>I wish she wouldn&#39;t talk about my height back then.</p><p>Well, I&#39;m not that tall even now, but I did grow, you know?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. I&#39;ve known Senpai since then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-I see. That&#39;s the first time I heard that.&quot;</p><p>I look away. She saw me during an embarrassing moment.</p><hr><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;Yes, we were both looking at the same thing.&quot;</p><p>With a gesture like a prayer, Sakura says something strange.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>I ask, feeling worried.</p><p>But as if to drown it out, the familiar bell echoes through the school.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Oh, the bell.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s been thirty minutes since I stopped Sakura. The clock says four-thirty.</p><p>&quot;I guess I held you up too long. I&#39;ll clean up, so you can go on ahead. You feel better, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, I feel great thanks to you. Please look forward to dinner tonight.&quot;</p><p>Sakura gets up.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem like she&#39;s bluffing as she really seems well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah... oh, sorry Sakura. I have to go to work now. I&#39;ll be late today, so you don&#39;t have to push yourself to come to my place.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I understand. Then I&#39;ll just cook your dinner and leave.&quot;</p><p>Sakura bows and leaves.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh well.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee will be at my house, so she should be able to take Sakura home when she leaves.</p><p>I have to make a living too, so I should go to work quickly....</p><hr><h2 id="scene-13-trivial-changes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-13-trivial-changes" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 13 - Trivial changes</h2><p>...My awakening is dark.</p><p>Perhaps I just don&#39;t dream much, but unless something really special happens, I always seem to have the same dream.</p><hr><p>...What I imagine are swords.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why it is, but this is the only thing that comes into my mind.</p><p>There&#39;s no meaning or reason to it.</p><p>It may just be one of the aspects making up Emiya Shirou.</p><hr><p>There are no dreams to dream.</p><p>The only things I recall from sleep are things I was taught a long time ago.</p><p>For example, about magi.</p><p>Even if I&#39;m an amateur, if I&#39;m a magus, it&#39;s only natural for me to understand the kind of world I live in.</p><hr><p>―――To put it simply, a magus is an exception in conflict with modern society.</p><p>But even exceptions must band together to survive.</p><p>Father told me that the group of magi is called the &quot;magecraft Association&quot;.</p><p>...He also said that I shouldn&#39;t associate with them.</p><hr><p>The group called the magecraft Association hides magecraft and organizes magi.</p><p>They basically keep watch to see that magi do not affect society with magecraft, but the strange part is that they do not prohibit misuse of magecraft.</p><hr><p>According to Kiritsugu, the magecraft Association is only interested in the concealment of magecraft.</p><p>Even if a magus carries out his research at the expense of the lives of many ordinary people, the magecraft Association will not punish him.</p><p>Their priority is that magecraft should not become public, so they do not ban magecraft.</p><p>So, they&#39;re crazy people who think you can do anything as long as you don&#39;t get caught.</p><hr><p>Anyway, the surveillance of the magecraft Association is thorough.</p><p>Most magical research would cost the lives of ordinary people, and as a result, the existence of magecraft would become public.</p><p>So, the Association does not allow research that would harm society.</p><hr><p>So magi stay at home and research quietly, while the normal world carries on unmolested.</p><p>Hence, magi only try to hide themselves to escape the Association.</p><p>...So perhaps I just don&#39;t know it, and a magus lives in this town.</p><hr><p>I hear Fuyuki City is a spiritually excellent area.</p><p>Such an area always has a distinguished magus with a history.</p><p>They are called the &quot;Second Owner&quot;, an elite, and the Association entrusts the area to them.</p><p>Magi who would live in the area must visit them and obtain their permission to construct a workshop.</p><hr><p>...Looking at it like that, we&#39;re thieves living here without the permission of the landlord.</p><p>Father was an outlaw who cut his ties with the Association and moved here without the consent of the administrator of Fuyuki.</p><hr><p>The Owner doesn&#39;t know that Emiya Kiritsugu was a magus, and Kiritsugu didn&#39;t know who the Owner was.</p><p>With reasoning like that, I think our position is ambiguous.</p><hr><p>Father, the real magus, has passed away.</p><p>And I, his son and pupil, don&#39;t know the magecraft Association and have not the skill to be a magus.</p><p>...From the Association&#39;s point of view, they would want to catch an amateur like me doing things, but I&#39;ve seen no movement yet.</p><p>No, I&#39;ve heard that Japan is relatively hidden from the eyes of the Association, so I think I&#39;ve just not been found out.</p><hr><p>―――But that doesn&#39;t mean I can let my guard down.</p><p>People say that the eyes of the Association are everywhere. On top of that, if you commit a crime with magecraft, the heretic hunters of the church will come after you.</p><p>...That just means that whatever you use magecraft for, lack of care will create enemies.</p><p>I, Emiya Shirou, just have to study independently, taking that into account――――</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm.&quot;</p><p>I wake up to see the sun shining in through the window.</p><p>The sun may have just risen as it&#39;s still a bit dark outside.</p><p>&quot;...Hm.

I see, you&#39;re their friend. Then I&#39;m sorry for stopping you. Well, I can go and get them. Or would you like to have dinner with us?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, I was just stopping by, so I&#39;ll be going. By the way, is Sakura home already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Zouken.&quot;</p><p>The old man says an unfamiliar word.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Matou Zouken. It is wrong for me to not name myself when you have done so.&quot;</p><p>Matou Zouken says so and walks toward the entrance.</p><p>It seems like he doesn&#39;t care about me any more.</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Overwhelmed, I see him off without a word.</p><hr><p>...And then.</p><p>&quot;Sakura is home.</p><p>More importantly, Emiya Shirou.

Have you finished preparing breakfast already?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, breakfast is done. All that&#39;s left is setting up the table and cooking the fish.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I&#39;ll help then. I&#39;ll prepare the dishes.&quot;</p><hr><p>Sakura is cheerful.</p><p>And behind that admirable junior...</p><p>&quot;Oh, this is the smell of Shirou&#39;s omelet. I see, you&#39;re making breakfast this morning.&quot;</p><p>Fuji-Nee moves slowly to the table.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Well, that aside...&quot;</p><p>First, I have to cook the fish I&#39;ve prepared.</p><p>&quot;Sakura, can you use the dishes in the middle? That will make it look better.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh.....? Um, this one with bumps?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, that. You have to think about the plates too or you&#39;ll be too one-sided. Oh, and the radish is already grated.&quot;</p><p>Sakura takes out a dish from the back.</p><p>&quot;―――&quot;</p><p>I think I saw a faint bruise on her wrist when she leaned forward.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on, Sakura.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, what is it Senpai?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s that mark on your wrist?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh...&quot;</p><p>She looks away awkwardly.</p><p>And that tells me who caused that bruise.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji again, huh? What does he think he&#39;s doing, beating on his sister...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;T-That&#39;s not it, Senpai...! Um, well... I fell and hurt myself. I&#39;m a bit slow, you know?</p><p>So I fall and get hurt a lot.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be stupid. How can you get a bruise like that from falling over? It seems Shinji isn&#39;t tired of getting beat up yet...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;N-No, Senpai...! This doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Nii-san. I really did this myself, so you can&#39;t get mad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――&quot;</p><p>Sakura falls silent.</p><p>...Sakura looks calm, but she is pretty obstinate. It&#39;s useless to say anything to her now.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. If you say so, I&#39;ll leave it at that. But if I see it again, I won&#39;t be able to hold back.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I&#39;m sorry, Senpai.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why are you apologizing? It&#39;s Shinji&#39;s fault.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>At the mention of Shinji&#39;s name, Sakura looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>In other words, he is the cause of that bruise.</p><p>Matou Shinji has a bad habit of being hard on his sister, Sakura.</p><p>I first noticed it about a year ago.</p><p>Sakura was injured sometimes, and she just evaded my question when I asked about it.</p><p>When I asked Shinji about it, of all things, he said he was the one who hit Sakura.</p><hr><p>When I asked him why he hit her, he said that he just hit her because he felt like it.</p><p>After that, I got pissed and did to Shinji what he did to Sakura.</p><p>Since then, we&#39;ve been estranged.</p><p>I still don&#39;t regret punching him.</p><p>But I think it&#39;s my fault that Sakura is being treated worse.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Senpai, did you... um, work things out with Nii-san?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? Yeah, I did. We didn&#39;t have a fight or anything, so it&#39;s not like there was anything to work out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Uh, it might be like that for you, but Nii-san thinks you guys got in a fight. So... well, please be careful.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>Sakura says strange things sometimes.</p><p>&quot;Be careful... you mean, of Shinji?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yes. I think Nii-san thinks of you as an enemy... um, and he thinks that you quit the club because of him....&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true. Me quitting the club had nothing to do with Shinji. Well, maybe a bit, but it&#39;s still not something you should worry about. Like Shinji says, this is certainly indecent.&quot;</p><p>I point at my right shoulder.</p><p>There&#39;s a scar there.</p><hr><p>It happened a year and a half ago.</p><p>A shipment collapsed on me during work and I hurt my right shoulder. I got out with just a broken bone, but the shipment was a hazardous one and I got a burn on my skin.</p><hr><p>After that accident, I quit the archery club.</p><p>My school archery club emphasizes formalities as they let us shoot formally even as students.</p><p>The men expose their right shoulder when they shoot.</p><p>Shinji commented that it might be indecent for someone shooting formally to have a scar on their shoulder. Since I was getting busy with work, I quit the archery club right then.</p><hr><p>&quot;Um, Senpai? I might be persistent, but are you really not shooting anymore? Fujimura-Sensei said your injury shouldn&#39;t be a problem.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What are you saying!? Fuji-Nee wouldn&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem even if I broke every bone in my body.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Senpai, I&#39;m being serious.&quot;</p><p>Sakura glances up at me, like she wants to say something.</p><p>&quot;...Hmm.&quot;</p><p>I should answer seriously too, but I can&#39;t give her the answer she wants.</p><hr><p>&quot;I don&#39;t have time to do club activities for now. I like archery, but it&#39;s not something I prioritize, so I&#39;m taking some time off from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...How long is &#39;some time&#39;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess until I feel like it.
