Caster looks around the temple.</p><hr><p>...This is it.</p><p>The surprise attack won&#39;t work on Caster anymore.</p><p>Tohsaka is tired and I can only project two more swords.</p><p>――――If...</p><p>If Caster uses &quot;her&quot; in this situation, we will never make it out of here alive――――</p><hr><p>&quot;......Phew. I thank you, Master. I would have been defeated without you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You do not need to flatter me. Just get Saber. We cannot take them lightly.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. That is a good decision, Master.&quot;</p><p>Caster points to the woman on the altar.</p><hr><p>The visible binding of the curse.</p><p>And when Caster tries to release it...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Yes. If only you had done it a few seconds sooner.&quot;</p><hr><p>Above me.</p><p>I hear a soft voice from the stairs leading up.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>It is Caster that notices the strange event first.</p><p>Kuzuki doesn&#39;t notice.</p><p>It is because Kuzuki cannot detect magical energy.</p><hr><p>Caster moves.</p><p>Above her Master...</p><p>Above Kuzuki Souichirou&#39;s head...</p><p>Are floating numerous swords.</p><p>&quot;Souichirou――――――――!&quot;</p><p>She must have figured out that her injuries will prevent her from blocking them with magecraft.</p><p>Caster uses her body to protect her Master.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Trace, on.&quot;</p><hr><p>The murmuring voice from above says those words.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...The sounds end.</p><p>The swords appearing in midair come down at one target and pierce one body.</p><p>The numerous blades rip and tear the meat, then disappear like an illusion.</p><hr><p>What&#39;s left are many traces of blood.</p><p>&quot;Ah...... guh...... ah...&quot;</p><p>It...</p><p>Having become his shield of her own free will, she now turns her bloody body to the man behind her.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki is silent.</p><p>In front of him is the skewered Servant.</p><p>...Maybe there&#39;s no need to hide it now.</p><p>The robe is removed from her head, and the woman walks over to her master with a bare face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah―――Ah, ah――――&quot;</p><p>...Her body is collapsing.</p><p>With a dying body, the woman looks up at her master who has not twitched a brow.</p><p>Her slender fingers run across the expressionless face.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh――――are you okay, Master?&quot;</p><p>Her voice seems clear.</p><p>There is no change in Kuzuki.</p><p>He only answers with a simple &quot;yes&quot; and does not even look at Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good. It would trouble me if you died.&quot;</p><p>She looks as if it is fine.</p><p>...No, the woman smiles knowing what kind of man he is.</p><hr><p>&quot;But this is cruel. I finally found a wish...&quot;</p><p>The fingers running along his cheek fall down.</p><p>Beginning at her toes, Caster&#39;s body is disappearing.</p><hr><p>&quot;You do not have to grieve. I will make your wish come true.&quot;</p><p>She smiles at the simple answer.</p><p>She smiles as if seeing a short-lived dream.</p><p>&quot;That is impossible. Because my wish...&quot;</p><hr><p>―――Was being fulfilled until now.</p><p>The witch collapses as if going to sleep.</p><hr><p>...The purple robe falls.</p><p>The robe without its wearer fades and disappears as if following her.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki does not even look at her. His attention is focused on the man above.</p><p>The knight in red who should be above me.</p><hr><p>――――I get a headache.</p><p>It&#39;s not just because I&#39;ve abused projection.</p><p>The muttered spell...</p><p>The spell he said is smashing my brain with nausea.</p><hr><p>―――――&#39;Trace, on&#39;.</p><p>That&#39;s what he said.</p><p>He said the exact words of the spell that shouldn&#39;t be used by anyone else but me.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer comes down the stairs and stands in the temple.</p><p>Tohsaka is watching him with surprise.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Archer... I thought so, but... it&#39;s true?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer does not answer.</p><p>He is only watching his enemy, Kuzuki.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Treacherous friend, huh? You were going for this from the start, Archer.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. But this is more like the Trojan horse.</p><p>I had to defeat the Greek hero. So this is more appropriate as a comparison.&quot;</p><p>Archer shows no guilt even though he has betrayed Caster in front of us.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I guess it was Caster&#39;s mistake for drawing in a guy like you.&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki does not change his tone even in front of a betrayer.</p><p>He still has the will to fight.</p><p>He is not a magus and he has lost Caster, but he has the will to continue fighting.</p><hr><p>...He readies himself.</p><p>As Caster is gone, Kuzuki&#39;s strength must have dropped substantially.</p><p>His &quot;snake&quot; is still there, but Caster&#39;s strengthening that made his fists into steel is gone.</p><p>But still, Kuzuki faces Archer like before.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I will not stop you if you want to continue.&quot;</p><p>Archer readies his twin swords.</p><p>Their duel has begun.</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――&quot;</p><p>Is that all right?</p><p>Kuzuki said he has no interest in the Holy Grail.</p><p>A Master in name only, he merely went along with Caster.</p><p>Then there&#39;s no reason for him to fight now that Caster&#39;s gone.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Hold on. Why are you continuing, Kuzuki? You were only doing as Caster told you. Caster&#39;s gone now, so there&#39;s no reason for you to fight anymore.&quot;</p><p>I glare at them, gritting my teeth against the pain.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki narrows his eyes a bit.</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. I do not have a reason to fight. Like you, I had no interest in the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Then...&quot;</p><p>&quot;But this is something I have started. I cannot stop midway.&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s it.</p><p>That&#39;s all the reason he has.</p><hr><p>――――The battle starts.</p><p>The battle should end in one blow.</p><p>Even if Kuzuki has superhuman fighting abilities, he&#39;s fighting a Servant.</p><p>He can&#39;t be a match just by being &quot;superhuman&quot;.</p><hr><p>Even though this is called a battle, it is actually just disposal of the loser.</p><p>The fate of the loser...</p><p>It is the battle between Masters to kill and be killed, and that is the end they have to be ready for. One shouldn&#39;t fight at all if he can&#39;t accept that.</p><p>But still――――</p><hr><h2 id="scene-01" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-01" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 01</h2><p>――――If I can save him...</p><p>Is it wrong to want to prevent his death if I can?</p><p>I don&#39;t care if I&#39;m called soft-hearted.</p><p>I know it&#39;s just hypocrisy.</p><hr><p>To defeat another Master means killing them.</p><p>We fought, prepared to kill each other.</p><p>I know how unfair it is to stop them now.</p><hr><p>But still.</p><p>I decided to fight so that I could save people.

We beat Caster, so I won&#39;t let you do anything selfish now...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let me...? I do not get it. Why do I have to ask for your permission? You&#39;re not my Master or anything.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh... Archer...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Our contract has ended. I am free now. Do you think I will subject myself to human control?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>After staring up at the knight in astonishment, Tohsaka gasps in sudden realization.</p><p>&quot;No way, Archer...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I will act to achieve my objective.</p><p>But it is troublesome to have you around.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka jumps back.</p><p>She gets away from Archer, tries to run towards me, who is still on my knees, and...</p><p>Her movement is stopped cold.</p><hr><p>A swarm of swords about two meters high.</p><p>They pierce the ground, drawing a circle, and become a circular prison.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s a circle big enough for one person to fit in,</p><p>and Tohsaka is trapped inside.</p><hr><p>&quot;I will not let you interfere after I&#39;ve come this far. Our contract has ended, so the binding of the Command Spell does not exist anymore.</p><p>That is the only reason I sided with Caster. I needed to break the contract to nullify that Command Spell.&quot;</p><hr><p>Turning his back to the imprisoned Tohsaka, Archer starts to walk.</p><p>Not towards Saber, but towards me, still on my knees.</p><hr><p>&quot;I thought so―――but why, Archer!? Do you still want to kill Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Yes, I will kill Emiya Shirou with my own hands.</p><p>This is the only wish I have after being reduced to a guardian.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wh――――at?&quot;</p><p>Power returns to Saber&#39;s body.</p><p>She musters her strength and moves between Archer and me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Archer. Do not tell me you are...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yes. You asked me once, right? Whether I had pride as a hero or not.</p><p>Of course not. I cannot have such a thing. Only regret fills my mind.</p><p>―――Saber, I shouldn&#39;t have become a hero.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>The aggression fades from Saber.</p><p>...What did she figure out? Her enmity towards Archer is gone.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s it. Step back, king of knights. You&#39;ll disappear right away if you act recklessly when you don&#39;t have a Master.</p><p>Emiya Shirou does not have his rights as a Master. Your wish cannot be granted even if you support him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I cannot do that. Even if he is not a Master, our contract will not go away. I have sworn to protect him and to be his sword.</p><p>...He knew nothing about the Holy Grail War, but he responded to my oath. I cannot betray his trust.&quot;</p><p>She readies her invisible sword.</p><p>But I don&#39;t see the usual valor or strength in her stance.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. Then you can die here along with the fake master.&quot;</p><p>Twin swords appear in Archer&#39;s hands.</p><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>...! Saber can&#39;t even take those swords right now...!</p><hr><p>&quot;――――You idiot. Run, Saber...!!&quot;</p><p>I get up and reach for Saber.</p><p>Did she do it to get away from my reach?</p><p>&quot;Hah――――!&quot;</p><p>Saber pulls herself together, kicks the ground, and charges at Archer.</p><hr><p>――――The battle ends after a few blows.</p><p>Saber, the one who overwhelmed Archer before, falls to her knees, unable to stand for even a few seconds.</p><hr><p>...The sword isn&#39;t even in Saber&#39;s hands now.</p><p>After resisting Caster&#39;s Command Spell for so long, she has no magical energy left.</p><p>Unable even to breathe, she puts her hands on the floor, desperately trying to hold her disappearing body together.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer raises his swords.</p><p>The twin swords are swung down onto Saber.</p><p>And...</p><p>&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHH――――――――!&quot;</p><p>I jump in from the side and stop them using all my might.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>I ready my twin swords.</p><p>I hold the instantly-projected weapons and glare at the knight in red.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Hm. I thought you would stay quiet for a bit longer. But I guess you cannot bear having a woman killed in front of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Shut up. I&#39;m the one you want to kill. Fight the right opponent.&quot;</p><p>I confront him.</p><p>We both have twin swords in our hands.</p><p>Our physiques are different, but our stances are the same in every regard.</p><hr><p>&quot;It is real if imitation goes that far. But―――can your body withstand that magecraft?&quot;</p><p>A sneering voice.</p><p>...My limit is near, as he says.</p><p>My headache does not stop and my Magic Circuit has its limiter full from all the projection magecraft.</p><p>...My brain will explode before I get slashed if I fight him while retaining the image of the twin swords.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Kuh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I warned you before. I told you that you cannot use projection. A magecraft beyond your powers will destroy your body. You are now paying the price of the magecraft that has kept you alive, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Archer charges in.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ku――――shut up, dammit――――!&quot;</p><p>To that.</p><p>I frantically move my swords as if slashing my headache away.</p><hr><p>――――I swing my arms.</p><p>My techniques are all a copy of my enemy&#39;s.</p><p>My weapon is copied and my technique is copied.</p><p>Therefore, I cannot match him.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t match him even if I were in top condition.</p><hr><p>An imitation can get close to the original, but never surpass it.</p><p>I could not match this man from the start.</p><hr><p>The man told me to drown in my ideals and die.</p><p>The man said that my life is a false life.</p><p>I could not object to those words because he was my ideal.</p><p>A power to make the impossible possible.</p><p>An existence that saved many people and became a heroic spirit.</p><p>It was I who wanted to become such a person.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s why I can&#39;t match him.</p><p>The man in front of me is the end of that road.</p><p>He is my ideal, becoming strong to save people, so――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah――――guh......!&quot;</p><p>My swords shatter.</p><p>I was able to block his attacks, but my twin swords disappear.</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t stay conscious.</p><p>My body isn&#39;t hurt, but my insides are bleeding and about to give out――――</p><hr><p>&quot;Do you understand now? That is the limit of Emiya Shirou. It is an appropriate end for a guy who kept pushing himself, right?&quot;</p><p>He raises his sword.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>As I try to figure out with my dazed mind if the sword will come down from the right or the left...</p><hr><p>&quot;I announce!</p><p>Thy body shall be under my command, my fate shall be determined by thy sword! Follow the call of the Holy Grail. If thou wouldst obey this mind and this reason―――&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka&#39;s gallant voice echoes through the temple.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>That must have caught his attention.</p><p>The sword slows down a bit. If that&#39;s the case――――</p><p>&quot;Kuh, ah――――&quot;</p><p>I can dodge it even with a body like this...!</p><hr><p>I roll on the floor and get away.</p><p>&quot;Damn――――!&quot;</p><p>Archer clenches his teeth, but looks at Saber instead of pursuing me.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Obey me! Then I shall entrust my fate to your sword...!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka reaches out towards Saber from within the prison of swords.</p><p>Saber runs to her using her last power and...</p><hr><p>&quot;I will accept your oath under the name of Saber...!</p><p>I shall accept you as my master, Rin―――!&quot;</p><p>A contract that should have originally been made...</p><p>Saber finally obtains a Master that is appropriate for her.</p><hr><p>Violent wind rages.</p><p>She must have gotten back her true powers by obtaining a true Master.</p><p>Saber is unlike anything she was before.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――, Wha-&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m not the only one that gasped.</p><p>Even Archer is fascinated.</p><p>Rising swirls of magical energy and armor that can never be damaged.</p><p>There seems to be no end to this overwhelming power.</p><p>―――This is Saber.</p><p>The heroic spirit of the sword said to be the strongest Servant―――!</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Damn. I was going to let her make a contract with Rin, but the order is getting mixed up.&quot;</p><p>Archer murmurs while looking at Saber. He must not have enough to spare to pay attention to me now.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what will you do now, Saber?</p><p>Since you have made a contract with Rin, you truly have no connection with Emiya Shirou now――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;I believe I told you, Archer. My oath with Shirou will never go away.&quot;</p><p>Saber is firm.</p><p>Archer clucks his tongue and grips his twin swords again.</p><hr><p>&quot;Rather, what are you going to be doing now, Archer? I will stop you with all my might if you try to kill Shirou.</p><p>Now will be the time to rethink. You do not think you have a chance to win against me now, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>Saber&#39;s warning is true.</p><p>Saber would not lose even to Berserker now.</p><p>No matter who he may be, Archer cannot match Saber.</p><p>He should know that more than anyone, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Hah. How can you be so confident when all you got back is some magical energy...!&quot;</p><p>Archer charges.</p><hr><p>Their weapons clash.</p><p>Archer charges in at Saber like a red bullet and attacks her with all his might.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――――Hah!&quot;</p><p>Saber receives the blow like nothing.</p><p>Neither the size difference nor Archer&#39;s momentum matter.</p><p>Saber repels Archer&#39;s swords without flinching.</p><hr><p>Archer, the one who attacked, is the one who retreats.</p><p>The attack made with all his strength, a blow that should not need to be repeated, is―――</p><p>&quot;Guh......!!!!&quot;</p><p>―――Not only is it blocked, but his body loses balance as well.</p><hr><p>&quot;Mm――――!&quot;</p><p>Archer steps back.</p><p>There...</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword attacks him like surging waves of raging fire――――!</p><hr><p>Archer can only defend against her attacks.</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword will kill him if he tries to counter.</p><hr><p>No, first of all, he does not have anything to spare for a counterattack.</p><p>The only resistance Archer is allowed is to block Saber&#39;s attacks until he runs out of energy.</p><hr><p>And that should not take long.</p><p>The magical energy in Saber&#39;s sword scrapes away Kanshou and Bakuya with each attack.</p><p>The twin swords cannot take any more, and Archer&#39;s arms should be powerless by now.</p><hr><p>The match is settled rather quickly.</p><p>Archer falls to one knee, unable to stand against Saber&#39;s assault.</p><p>Saber swings down her sword as if to finish him off.</p><hr><p>Archer blocks it by crossing his twin swords in front of him.</p><p>The battle is at an end.</p><p>Even though he blocked Saber&#39;s blow, Archer cannot move.</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword will split his head in two if he loosens his power on the twin swords.</p><hr><p>&quot;Nu――――hm......!&quot;</p><p>Archer puts power into his arms to stop Saber&#39;s blow.</p><p>Sweat forms on his forehead and he&#39;s breathing hard.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>In contrast, Saber&#39;s breathing is normal.</p><p>It is impossible for Archer to beat Saber in hand-to-hand combat.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――This is it, Archer.</p><p>It might have been different if you were in perfect condition, but you cannot fight on with your depleted strength.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You were worried about me earlier,</p><p>but that goes the same for you. You should have no magical energy left since you used that many Noble Phantasms to defeat Caster.</p><p>Furthermore, you do not have a Master to keep you in this world. What can you do when you have no supply of magical energy?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hah―――that is needless worry, Saber.</p><p>Servant Archer has the ability to remain even after the Master is gone. I should be able to stay in this world for two days even without a Master. That is enough time for me to kill that kid.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Ridiculous. Are you still talking about such a thing...!? Are you saying your wish is not the Holy Grail, but to kill Shirou...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer doesn&#39;t answer.</p><p>His cold eyes stare at the troubled Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;...How can it be? Archer, your wish is a mistake.</p><p>Why―――Why do you wish for such an end? Even if you do so, you...&quot;</p><p>――Will not be saved.</p><p>Saber bites her lips and stops herself from saying so.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Heh. I&#39;m mistaken, huh?&quot;</p><p>The muscles on Archer&#39;s arms bulge.</p><p>He looks at Saber once,</p><p>&quot;That is my line, Saber.</p><p>How long are you going to hold on to that foolish wish of yours?&quot;</p><p>He says so with eyes staring far away.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――Archer.&quot;</p><p>Saber&#39;s sword loosens up.</p><p>&quot;Fu――――!&quot;</p><p>Using that opening, Archer gets up and kicks Saber with his freed leg...!</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>Even though she&#39;s knocked back, Saber lands gracefully.</p><p>The situation hasn&#39;t changed at all.</p><p>Saber is protecting me and facing Archer, who has Tohsaka trapped within a cage of swords behind him.</p><p>The distance between them is five meters again.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Phew. I knew it, but I cannot match you in sword techniques, huh?&quot;</p><p>With that, Archer empties his hands.</p><p>The twin swords disappear and he confronts Saber unarmed.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Archer. Does that mean you will give up now――――?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course not. You&#39;re misunderstanding me. I&#39;m Archer. I&#39;m not someone who fights using a sword to begin with.&quot;</p><p>With those words...</p><hr><p>&quot;I am the bone of my sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>He begins this spell in a voice I can&#39;t hear.</p><hr><p>&quot;Stop, Archer! I do not――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;Saber. Someone will eventually appear to release you.</p><p>It does not seem like it is this time―――and I will probably have a connection with you again next time.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Unknown to Death. Nor known to Life.&quot;</p><hr><p>His spell echoes through the temple.</p><p>...There&#39;s no change.</p><p>A long spell like that should affect the surroundings.</p><p>magecraft influences the world.</p><p>But his spell does not affect the world, but instead―――</p><hr><p>&quot;But that is still far off. Right now, my objective is to kill Emiya Shirou.</p><p>If you are going to try to stop me――――I will not hold back against you even in this world.&quot;</p><hr><p>He raises his left arm.</p><p>Does that complete his spell?</p><hr><p>&quot;[block len=3]―――unlimited blade works.&quot;</p><hr><p>He clearly speaks out and changes the world.</p><hr><p>――――Fire runs.</p><p>It runs across the floor and looks like a white line.</p><p>Is the surrounding fire a boundary line?</p><p>The color of fire fills my vision and paints the temple.</p><p>After that, my surroundings are replaced by [wrap̠text=&quot;this&quot;]this strange world.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Pain fills my brain.</p><hr><p>―――I can tell.</p><p>I understand what this magecraft is, what this absurdity is.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t be able to understand, but I can tell what this is whether I want to or not.</p><p>And that――――</p><p>...Makes my brain boil.</p><hr><p>In short, this is a steel manufacturing factory.</p><p>Burning fire and turning cogwheels.</p><p>A field of swords without owners extends to the horizon of the desert.</p><p>All the swords in the ground are famous.</p><p>Kanshou and Bakuya originally came from this world.</p><p>An almost infinite projection of weapons.</p><p>Innumerable weapons make this place seem like a wasteyard.</p><p>The knight in red reigns at the center of this kingdom of rubble.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is――――&quot;</p><p>The confused voice is Saber&#39;s.</p><p>Inside the illusionary fire that is not even hot, she watches the knight in blank amazement.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Reality Marble.</p><p>A great forbidden magecraft that puts form to the user&#39;s mind and violates reality.</p><p>So you&#39;re not a swordsman nor an archer, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. I was a magus before I became a heroic spirit.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka sounds disinterested.</p><p>...Could it be?</p><p>Did she... already know... Archer&#39;s true identity?</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Then Archer. Your Noble Phantasm is...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I have no such thing.</p><p>I did not wield any holy swords nor demonic swords. The only thing I have is this world.</p><p>If a Noble Phantasm is the symbol of a heroic spirit, this Reality Marble is my Noble Phantasm.</p><p>I can reproduce and store any weapon that I see the original of. This is my ability as a heroic spirit.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Saber gasps.</p><p>She looks with blank amazement at the extending graveyard of swords in the desert.</p><p>The ashen sky and steel wasteland, devoid of all life.</p><hr><p>&quot;This is... your world, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I do not mind if you would like to test it out.</p><p>I shall reproduce that holy sword of yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;My holy sword...? Are you saying that, knowing its true identity, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. A weapon of such rank cannot be perfectly reproduced, but I can get it close.</p><p>What will happen in that case? Will the people around us survive when the two holy swords clash?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Wha――――Archer, you...!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. Do not use your holy sword, Saber. I will have to oppose you if you do.</p><p>In that case, the ones to disappear would not be us, but the people around us.</p><p>...Knowing you, you would protect that kid at the cost of your own life. Even I will die if I project the holy sword.</p><p>In that case, only Emiya Shirou would survive. That would be pointless.&quot;</p><hr><p>Archer raises his left arm.</p><p>The swords behind him float up one by one.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Do not oppose it.</p><p>You should not die instantly if you are lucky. You can have your Master heal you after it is all over.&quot;</p><p>Archer points to Saber.</p><p>The numerous swords point towards Saber.</p><p>All of these weapons are sure to kill.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――You can dodge them, but in that case, give up on the kid behind you.&quot;</p><p>And he gives the command.</p><hr><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>The numerous swords are shot.</p><p>Saber does not move.</p><p>She confronts them, intending to deflect all the weapons using her sword, even prepared for her own death――――</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――Trace, on.&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t think because of my headache.</p><p>My Magic Circuit can only handle one more projection.</p><p>My insides are burned up and almost melted.</p><p>But such concerns vanished when I saw this world.</p><p>Before I realize it, I have jumped up, run to Saber, and am glaring at the annoying swords.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou!? No, quickly――――&quot;</p><hr><p>I don&#39;t care.</p><p>For now, the oncoming 18 swords. Analysis of all of them cannot be completed with my eyes alone, so my senses run wild and...</p><p>Go past the fastest speed, go faster and faster and faster...</p><hr><p>They approach.</p><p>Something like a cocking hammer goes down in my head.</p><hr><p>&quot;Don&#39;t――――&quot;</p><p>I stick out my left arm.</p><p>I have no doubts.</p><p>I&#39;ve copied him so many times.</p><p>If there is nothing wrong with the theory...</p><p>&quot;―――Be ridiculous, dammit...――――!!!!&quot;</p><p>...There is no way I can&#39;t reproduce the rain of swords in front of me――――!</p><hr><p>...Broken pieces fly around.</p><p>When I open my eyes, his Reality Marble has disappeared.</p><p>The only things there are the broken pieces of swords and...</p><p>&quot;Haa――――ah――――, ah, ha――――!&quot;</p><p>...A hellish nausea as if my organs have come up to my throat.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>After glaring at me in disgust...</p><p>&quot;Hey―――Archer, you――――!?&quot;</p><p>He takes out Tohsaka from the cage of swords and restrains her.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! ............!&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka struggles to get away from Archer.</p><p>&quot;Ah――――huh......?&quot;</p><p>What did he do? Archer places his hand on Tohsaka&#39;s neck and renders her unconscious.</p><hr><p>...And he leaves the temple.</p><p>With Tohsaka in his arms, Archer jumps to the stairs leading up.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Where are you going, Archer?&quot;</p><p>&quot;To a place where there won&#39;t be any intrusions.</p><p>I am out of magical energy as well. I do not have enough power to defeat both of you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Are you taking Rin as a hostage?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, she is an exchange. As long as I have her, that kid has to come after me.</p><p>But more importantly, Rin is your Master now. Even if you want to protect that kid, you should not be able to put his life over your Master&#39;s.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I bear my nausea.</p><p>I strain my fainting mind and listen to what he has to say.</p><p>&quot;――――The... outskirts.&quot;</p><p>And.</p><p>I say so with a shaking throat, not even able to look up.</p><hr><p>&quot;What?&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――I said the forest in the outskirts of the town. There&#39;s an empty castle there. We won&#39;t cause trouble for anyone there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou...!?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You want to complain to me, right? Fine, I&#39;ll listen.</p><p>I also have complaints against you.&quot;</p><p>My vision flickers.</p><p>Even as I speak, I feel sick, as if in another dimension.</p><hr><p>&quot;The forest outside the city... I see, the Einzbern castle is there.</p><p>There certainly should be no interruptions there.</p><p>―――Hah, that is good determination, Emiya Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Shut up. But...&quot;</p><p>I don&#39;t want to hear meaningless things.</p><p>If I do hear them, I won&#39;t be able to hold this nausea in and I might vomit out my organs.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Do something to Tohsaka before then.</p><p>And I&#39;ll kill you with Saber for sure.&quot;</p><p>I make this oath.</p><p>I violently scratch my forehead, tearing off the skin in an attempt to silence my headache.</p><hr><p>&quot;All right. I shall guarantee a day of her safety in deference to the specification of the place.</p><p>―――But hurry. I don&#39;t have time, as I have no Master. My body should not last two more days.</p><p>I might kill my hostage out of anger if I cannot kill you in that time.&quot;</p><hr><p>...Leaving an annoying laugh, Archer disappears.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I slump to the floor, unable to keep my eyes on him.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou...! It is too early for you to use the same projection as Archer...!&quot;</p><p>An arm comes and supports me as I start to fall.</p><hr><p>&quot;......I&#39;m sorry, Saber. He got Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>I suppress my headache and manage to get up.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou... that is fine. Rin is safe. Archer should not do anything to Rin.</p><p>You are in more of a danger right now. You should leave Rin to me and rest at your place.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......No. I don&#39;t have such time...&quot;</p><p>I try to finish, but I start to faint.</p><p>...Damn.</p><p>I can&#39;t even complain, huh?</p><hr><p>&quot;I will listen to you later. I will take you to your house for now. That is fine, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Hey――――wai-&quot;</p><p>...I don&#39;t even get to object.</p><p>Saber supports me and starts to walk to the stairs.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-04" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-04" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 04</h2><p>&quot;Shirou. Are your wounds all right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh――――? Oh, yeah, it&#39;s fine. I feel good, and I can still use my circuits.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. That is good.&quot;</p><hr><p>Apparently having run out of things to talk about, Saber awkwardly ends the conversation.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>We&#39;ve been like this for an hour since we came home.</p><p>We don&#39;t have the composure to be celebrating Tohsaka&#39;s safety, nor did we celebrate our reunion.</p><hr><p>The situation isn&#39;t good at all.</p><p>The last Servant, Gilgamesh.</p><p>As long as he has the Holy Grail, we have to fight him.</p><hr><p>...We don&#39;t have any plans to beat him. The more we think about it, the more we realize it&#39;s hopeless.</p><p>It&#39;s only natural for us to grow quiet.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the only reason we&#39;re quiet.</p><p>...This is probably the end.</p><p>This will be the last time we will go into battle like this.</p><p>No matter what the results may be, what awaits us does not change.</p><hr><p>The Holy Grail War will end.</p><p>After that―――the three of us won&#39;t be able to talk like this.</p><hr><p>Looking back, it was only a course of about ten days.</p><p>I never had time to think back about what happened the day before, and I was too busy with all the events that came up one after another.</p><p>...But they weren&#39;t just painful events.</p><p>Looking back at it, these past ten days are precious memories that can&#39;t be replaced.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s why we&#39;re keeping our mouths shut.</p><p>We don&#39;t want to admit the obvious truth.</p><hr><p>The decision should be clear to all of us already.</p><p>We can&#39;t say it because we don&#39;t want to end it like this.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Then I&#39;ll say it.</p><p>I&#39;m going to avenge Archer. He betrayed me and he was a twisted guy, but he&#39;s Shirou.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka has made up her mind.</p><p>She says that she will fight Gilgamesh.</p><p>She clearly states that she will end this fight.</p><hr><p>&quot;How about you, Shirou? I&#39;ll have Saber come with me no matter what, but I can&#39;t force you to fight since you&#39;re not a Master.</p><p>It seems that goldie really hates you, so I think he&#39;ll go after you first if we fight him.&quot;</p><hr><p>Maybe Tohsaka&#39;s trying to be considerate by offering me an escape.</p><p>But I&#39;m already determined.</p><p>I can&#39;t let Gilgamesh be.</p><p>I intuitively know that the Holy Grail shouldn&#39;t exist.</p><p>But there&#39;s a bigger reason for me not to back out of this.</p><hr><p>――――You defeat him.</p><p>He left those words and let me survive instead of him.</p><p>...The man who only denied Emiya Shirou.</p><p>As I have made him admit his defeat, my path is determined.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I&#39;m going to defeat him. I chose to fight. He&#39;ll complain to me unless I keep my word until the very end.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I won&#39;t stop you if that&#39;s what you decided.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. And I can&#39;t just ignore the Holy Grail.</p><p>If the Holy Grail is what he says it is, we have to destroy it. We&#39;ll completely destroy it so something like this will never happen again.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Saber has fought with the objective of obtaining the Holy Grail.</p><p>Her hesitation and reluctance aren&#39;t easily overcome. But still...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I understand.</p><p>If the Holy Grail is what Gilgamesh says it is, it should not exist in this world.&quot;</p><p>She kills her wish and assents.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――All right!&quot;</p><p>I get up and head to the kitchen.</p><p>I put on the apron.</p><p>I tie it behind my back and roll up my sleeves.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;W-What? Did you come up with a good idea?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? No, I&#39;m just going to make something. You two are hungry, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>I ignore the astonished party and start preparing dinner.</p><hr><p>&quot;It&#39;s all decided. Now, we just need to act like always.</p><p>We&#39;ll eat dinner together and go beat him after that.&quot;</p><hr><p>I take out a bowl and a frying pan.</p><p>I&#39;ll use everything I have in the refrigerator.</p><p>I&#39;ll forget about everything tonight. I&#39;ll make a delicious feast.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――You are right. Let us eat dinner like always. That suits us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. Then I guess I&#39;ll help as well. Oh, Saber. Can you go prepare the bath?&quot;</p><hr><p>The serious atmosphere disappears like that.</p><p>The living room suddenly becomes more lively.</p><p>This will be the last night with the three of us.</p><p>We&#39;re doing our best to keep it like always and to have a good dinner.</p><hr><p>――――So.</p><p>After eating dinner consisting of Western, Chinese, and Japanese food, we start the customary strategy meeting.</p><hr><p>&quot;So you are saying the Holy Grail is at the Ryuudou Temple?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yup. I guessed that the Ryuudou Temple would be the summoning spot this time. I was using a familiar to spy on that place, but it was eliminated just a bit earlier. I&#39;m sure that the goldie is there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ryuudou Temple... That is troublesome.</p><p>We can only enter that mountain through the front gate. Gilgamesh should be waiting for us there.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. But on the other hand, it&#39;s easier on us because we know where he is.</p><p>He&#39;s troublesome, but stopping the summoning of the Holy Grail takes priority.</p><p>It would be ideal if we can destroy the Holy Grail while Saber keeps him busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hold on. Isn&#39;t Saber the only one who can destroy the Holy Grail? We can&#39;t touch it, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Right. We can&#39;t destroy the summoned Holy Grail. But we can destroy the vessel before it&#39;s summoned.</p><p>To be more precise, we&#39;re stopping the Holy Grail before it&#39;s activated.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm? What do you mean by stopping the Holy Grail?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I really don&#39;t want to think about it, but from what I heard, the Holy Grail is Illyasviel&#39;s heart, right?</p><p>But I think the Holy Grail is a set with Illyasviel&#39;s body, her Magic Circuit.</p><p>He didn&#39;t want Illyasviel to be the Holy Grail, so he pulled out the core of it, her heart.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......So.</p><p>He has to implant the heart into a magus&#39;s body to activate it as the Holy Grail. There are only two remaining Masters: me, and one other.</p><p>Since I&#39;m here, the one he will choose to be the foundation of the Holy Grail is――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Shinji...!? But Shinji, um...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Doesn&#39;t have a Magic Circuit, right? ...I bet he doesn&#39;t care.</p><p>He wants to make an incomplete Holy Grail, so I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll implant it into an incomplete Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Even if its bloodline is extinct, the Matou family has hereditary traces of magecraft-Circuits.</p><p>Even a closed circuit will be forced to open if something like a nuclear fusion reactor is implanted into him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Then that would mean we&#39;ll have to detach the Holy Grail from Shinji, huh?</p><p>I don&#39;t know what it means to be the Holy Grail&#39;s foundation, but, if possible, we&#39;ll have to stop it.</p><hr><p>&quot;But I do not think Gilgamesh will allow that.</p><p>Does it not mean that stopping the Holy Grail is to defeat Gilgamesh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...Yeah. It&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s protecting the Holy Grail, so we have to do something about him first.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. I think he&#39;s waiting for us at the mountain gate. The only route we have is the mountain gate because our greatest force, Saber, can only enter through there.</p><p>So――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see.</p><p>I will rush the mountain gate by myself.</p><p>Rin and Shirou will sneak into the Ryuudou Temple from the back while I do so.</p><p>The boundary field on the Ryuudou Temple is meaningless for you two.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Exactly. ...You will need to give your absolute best, but just keep him busy. We&#39;ll come help you as soon as we stop the Holy Grail.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Hold on. That&#39;s reckless. Saber won&#39;t be a match for him.</p><p>She can&#39;t keep him busy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh? What? You seem to think pretty highly of him, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;True. He is a strong enemy, but I will not lose easily if I go into defense.</p><p>Please tell me what that opinion is based on.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, that&#39;s not what I meant. From what I see, Saber&#39;s stronger than him.</p><p>I&#39;m sure of it. I&#39;ll bet on it too.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Then why are you saying that?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;You can&#39;t beat him as long as you&#39;re a heroic spirit.</p><p>...Yeah, Saber won&#39;t lose if he only had the same Noble Phantasm as Saber. We don&#39;t even need to compare the two&#39;s skills as swordsmen.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;But his power isn&#39;t power as an &#39;individual&#39;. A soldier can&#39;t beat war itself no matter how strong he is, right?</p><p>He&#39;s a heroic spirit of that kind. You&#39;ll be defeated unless you&#39;re a &#39;war&#39; just like him.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? ...So you are telling me that my attributes are not fit to fight him?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. Tohsaka, we can&#39;t let Saber fight him without a plan. There&#39;s no way she can win unless we have some sort of a countermeasure.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey... I know that already.</p><p>That&#39;s why we&#39;re going to think about it now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm. Then you have a plan, Rin?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey now. I won&#39;t conveniently come up with an idea in a flash.</p><p>His Noble Phantasm is a war, like Shirou said.</p><p>The outcome of a war is decided by how much force you have, right? It&#39;s not how well you can handle the weapon. It&#39;s how much force you can prepare――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......? What&#39;s wrong, Tohsaka? Why did you shut up all of a sudden?&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I see. That&#39;s why he treated you like an enemy. Since the heroic spirit doesn&#39;t have his own Noble Phantasm, there is no original. Oh... wait. That means...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Rin? What is wrong? Why are you behind me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I-It&#39;s nothing...! I&#39;m going to think, so just talk it over with just the two of you...!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...?&quot;</p><p>Saber and I look at each other.</p><p>...Well, I&#39;ll leave her alone if she has an idea.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then I should avoid fighting Archer one-on-one, correct?</p><p>But I have backup from Rin.</p><p>I can use my Noble Phantasm with her support. I believe there is a chance of beating him before he can use his Noble Phantasm.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Your Noble Phantasm...? Not Invisible Air?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Invisible Air is only a sheath.</p><p>I can use my holy sword if Rin allows it.</p><p>This is the sword that previously destroyed the Holy Grail.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. Then it&#39;ll all be up to Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. There will be a big burden on me as well as Rin if I use it. I will probably use up most of her magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Did you hear that, Tohsaka? How much magical energy can you spare?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;M-Magical energy I can spare? How do you know what I&#39;m thinking about...!?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...N-No, it&#39;s nothing. I told you to leave me alone. I know about Saber&#39;s Noble Phantasm.</p><p>She should be able to use it twice with our magical energy.</p><p>We&#39;re going to use it once against the Holy Grail, so you can only use it once against Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Um, Saber. That&#39;s what Tohsaka&#39;s saying, so what do you think?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I do not know. If Archer has every existing Noble Phantasm, he should have one that can equal mine. After that, it depends on whose is stronger.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. So it&#39;s going to end up being a fight between the Noble Phantasms, huh?&quot;</p><p>...Then Gilgamesh is likely to win.</p><p>I can&#39;t let Saber fight such a hopeless battle―――</p><hr><p>Man, I can&#39;t think!</p><p>She&#39;s been acting strange.</p><p>Why does she keep on looking at me like that?</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, Tohsaka. Come out with it if you want to say something. You have an idea, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――I-I don&#39;t have an idea! I can&#39;t say such a thing here, you idiot!&quot;</p><hr><p>She yells at me and looks away awkwardly.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Shirou?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing. She&#39;s acting weird, so let&#39;s ignore her and keep planning.&quot;</p><hr><p>We continue with the strategy meeting with just the two of us.</p><p>...But as our &quot;brain&quot;, Tohsaka, won&#39;t talk, we can&#39;t come up with anything.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――We can go with the previous plan if you guys can&#39;t come up with anything.</p><p>We&#39;ll head out before dawn. Everybody is to rest until then.&quot;</p><p>Our course of action is decided by Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>――――Some time passed after that.</p><p>It&#39;s almost midnight.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka told me I should take a nap, but I can&#39;t sleep in a situation like this.</p><p>We&#39;re going to settle our score with that Servant in a few hours.</p><p>Since we are heading out before dawn, everything should be over by the time the sun rises.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I can&#39;t just lay here and not do anything.</p><p>I――――</p><hr><h2 id="scene-05" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-05" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 05</h2><p>&quot;―――Yeah. I can&#39;t sleep in this situation.&quot;</p><p>A plan against Gilgamesh.</p><p>If we are to fight that cold-hearted enemy, I&#39;ll have to come up with some plan.</p><hr><p>Someone will die if we head to the Ryuudou Temple as we are now.</p><p>Compared to that, thinking until the very last minute is nothing.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you awake, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>I knock on her door.</p><hr><p>&quot;......! H-Hold on! Don&#39;t come in!&quot;</p><p>......Hm.</p><p>I thought Tohsaka would be sleeping, but I guess she&#39;s still awake.</p><hr><p>More importantly, she&#39;s in a panic.</p><p>After a few minutes of rustling sounds...</p><p>She must have calmed down.</p><p>After taking a breath I can hear even outside, Tohsaka opens the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;So, what?&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me as soon as she sees me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well. I want to continue our conversation from earlier. I want to keep talking about how to fight Gilgamesh.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>......Wait.</p><p>Why are you glaring at me?</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Are you in a bad mood?&quot;</p><p>I ask the obvious.</p><p>OF COURSE!</p><p>That&#39;s the obvious response she&#39;s going to give, but I have to ask.</p><p>But...</p><hr><p>&quot;...No. That&#39;s not true.&quot;</p><p>She gives a strange response.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. Are you sick or something?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! ...Geez, just sit down!</p><p>I&#39;m going to give you a plan to beat Gilgamesh since you can&#39;t come up with any!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka pulls me inside, locks the door, and walks to the back of the room.</p><hr><p>&quot;......?&quot;</p><p>I move to the center of the room for now.</p><p>I sit down on the cushion and face Tohsaka, who is sitting in a chair.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>And an awkward silence follows.</p><p>Tohsaka is silent even though she&#39;s the one with the plan.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tohsaka. About Gilgamesh...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I know. You don&#39;t want Saber fighting him, right? You&#39;re especially kind to her.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey, that&#39;s not the point here.</p><p>I&#39;m saying that we should switch the roles since Saber won&#39;t fare well against Gilgamesh. If Saber is defeated, you&#39;ll be his next target.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;......Humph. You say switch roles, so what are you thinking?</p><p>I&#39;m going to pass. That goldie used his riches to collect all the magecraft-resistant equipment in the world.</p><p>I&#39;ll do much worse than Saber. That should be the same for you as well, right?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s... true, but...</p><hr><p>...I can&#39;t get those eyes out of my head.</p><p>Archer definitely told me this.</p><p>That the golden Servant...</p><p>That only Emiya Shirou can match Gilgamesh.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-06" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-06" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 06</h2><p>I&#39;ll go talk to Saber.</p><p>...Even if we&#39;re able to defeat Gilgamesh, Saber will leave once the war ends.</p><p>Saber will destroy the Holy Grail herself and be relieved of her duty as a Servant.</p><p>I won&#39;t be able to see her ever again.</p><hr><p>...A last conversation.</p><p>I want to save something between us before we go into our final battle.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou? Why are you here?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, I just felt like coming to see you. Oh, am I a bother? Were you meditating in preparation for the battle?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Eh―――n-no. That is not true.</p><p>I am happy since I wanted to see you as well, but... Um, I thought you went to Rin&#39;s room.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...? Why would I go to Tohsaka&#39;s room? She didn&#39;t call for me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Y-You are right. Please do not worry about it since it was just my imagination.</p><p>I-I thought that would be for the better, but I guess that was my concern.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;???&quot;</p><p>Saber is acting even weirder.</p><p>...I don&#39;t know why, but I guess she&#39;ll blush even more if I let her be.</p><hr><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Saber? You&#39;re acting weird.</p><p>Did something happen?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I-I am not acting weird! I am merely resting in preparation for the battle.</p><p>But what about you, Shirou? I thought you were going to sleep so that you can go to the Ryuudou Temple in perfect condition.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm.&quot;</p><p>If she asks me like that, I can&#39;t tell her it&#39;s because I wanted to see her face.</p><hr><p>I can&#39;t tell her, so...</p><p>&quot;...Hm, I couldn&#39;t sleep either. I just thought I&#39;d drink tea with you since I&#39;m awake.</p><p>I think Tohsaka&#39;s busy, you know?&quot;</p><p>I come up with an excuse on a whim.</p><hr><p>&quot;Tea...? Even though we will be fighting the king of heroes in a few hours?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah. We can&#39;t rest because we&#39;re so tensed up, right?</p><p>Then have tea with me. I&#39;ll make you the best tea.&quot;</p><p>I invite Saber by force.</p><p>My face is all red and it&#39;s embarrassing, but I want to drink tea with Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes. It will be my pleasure to have tea with you, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>Saber nods kindly.</p><hr><p>―――If it&#39;s decided, I should hurry up.</p><p>I&#39;ll go to the kitchen, brew the Chinese tea I bought for a special occasion, and I&#39;ll treat Saber―――</p><hr><p>―――So.</p><p>We didn&#39;t do anything but drink the tea.</p><p>We didn&#39;t talk, not even a single word.</p><p>We just absent-mindedly stared at the dojo.</p><p>We watched the wooden floor we used to train on.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou. Please go see Rin. Knowing her, I am sure she has her new idea thought out.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, really? I guess I&#39;ll go if you say so.&quot;</p><p>I get up and leave the dojo.</p><hr><p>&quot;I shall see you later, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I&#39;m gonna go check on your foul-tempered Master.&quot;</p><hr><p>I leave the dojo while Saber sees me off.</p><p>―――That ends our final time together.</p><p>I didn&#39;t leave anything definite.</p><p>I couldn&#39;t make any sure promise, no sensations I would be able to recall, no proof at all of Saber&#39;s existence.</p><hr><p>...But I think this is right.</p><p>What&#39;s left are memories that fade away.</p><p>So I&#39;ll cherish this trifling event and hold it strong in my heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;Hey. Are you awake, Tohsaka?&quot;</p><p>I knock on the door.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m awake. Don&#39;t you have to sleep? I thought you were talking to Saber in the dojo until a minute ago.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh, were you watching?</p><p>...I see, you can see the dojo from your room.</p><p>You should&#39;ve come, Tohsaka. It would&#39;ve been better to have tea with the three of us.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;............That&#39;s fine.</p><p>............That&#39;s not fine at all.</p><p>Well, come on in. I was about to go talk to you anyways.&quot;</p><p>Hmm. Those are surprisingly biting words.</p><hr><p>&quot;...All right. Excuse me.&quot;</p><p>I tilt my head in wonder as I enter her room.</p><hr><p>&quot;I guess you&#39;re pretty calm. What were you doing with Saber?&quot;</p><p>Then.</p><p>Tohsaka glares at me the instant I see her.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. I was only drinking tea with her.</p><p>We can&#39;t be training when we&#39;re going to be fighting soon. I can&#39;t use up extra energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Extra energy――――y-you&#39;re right.

I don&#39;t know who told you that, but you&#39;re right.</p><p>What makes Gilgamesh so strong is the number of Noble Phantasms he has. But to put it another way, one can match him if one has the same number of Noble Phantasms.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――The same number of Noble Phantasms...&quot;</p><p>It means I need to reproduce all the Noble Phantasms he takes out.</p><hr><p>&quot;...That&#39;s right. He was calling you guys fakers. That&#39;s probably because he saw you two as a threat. Heroic spirit Emiya would be a complete match for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That&#39;s true, but...</p><hr><p>&quot;...But that&#39;s impossible.</p><p>I can barely manage to project one of Archer&#39;s swords.</p><p>I can&#39;t keep up with his Noble Phantasms, and I don&#39;t have enough magical energy to do so.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s if your magecraft is just like it was until now.</p><p>But you remember what Archer&#39;s Noble Phantasm was, right?</p><p>You can match Gilgamesh if you can use that magecraft―――that Reality Marble.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka stares at me.</p><p>But I can&#39;t live up to her expectation.</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s impossible. The Reality Marble is the ultimate forbidden magecraft. I don&#39;t know how to use it, and Archer used magical energy several times my capacity to create that world. That&#39;s totally impossible.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. I know it&#39;s impossible.</p><p>But you should know how to use it because all your magecraft is rooted in that.</p><p>&#39;Strengthening&#39; and &#39;projection&#39; both stem from your Reality Marble.</p><p>I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be a piece of cake once you have the necessary magical energy.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>She&#39;s talking about impossible things.</p><p>I have no way to do it, so this is more impossible than for me to go to the moon.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Okay. Let&#39;s say that&#39;s the case. But it&#39;s still impossible. I don&#39;t have the magical energy to set up the boundary field or maintain it.</p><p>He must have trained his Magic Circuit for a long time, but I don&#39;t have the magical energy――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know.</p><p>So, um... See, Gilgamesh said it too, right? Magi take it from somewhere else if they can&#39;t supply it themselves.&quot;</p><p>She murmurs.</p><hr><p>&quot;...? He did say something like that, but what about it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Geez! ...So, um, I have to do something about the insufficient part.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka blushes furiously, her voice trailing off to a whisper.</p><hr><p>&quot;W――――――――&quot;</p><p>I know.</p><p>I&#39;m a magus, even if I may be an amateur.</p><p>I know what Tohsaka just said.</p><hr><p>&quot;T――――Tohsaka, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;...There are only a few ways for magi to tune in, right? We&#39;re of the opposite sex and we don&#39;t have time, so it&#39;s the most efficient way since it&#39;s like a contract...&quot;</p><hr><p>So.</p><p>I&#39;m going to have sex with Tohsaka to connect with her so that I can use her magical energy.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Ah, uh?&quot;</p><p>My head explodes.</p><p>My memory of the past few days gets blown away once I think about what Tohsaka said.</p><hr><p>――――It&#39;s Tohsaka we&#39;re talking about.</p><p>She&#39;s a female student I admired, recently got close to, realized her honor student appearance is fake, got attracted to her even more anyway, and my heart won&#39;t stop beating rapidly when I&#39;m near her... So why did it turn out like this?</p><hr><p>&quot;...What? We&#39;re just going to be having sex. I think it&#39;s much easier than fighting with your life on the line.&quot;</p><p>Y-YOU IDIOOOOOOOT!!!!</p><p>PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE IS MUCH, MUCH EASIER!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><hr><p>&quot;H-HOLD ONNNNNNN!!</p><p>That&#39;s strange.

I won&#39;t be fooled so easily!&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka is staring at me.</p><p>Her gesture is more convincing than any words.</p><hr><p>&quot;Ah, guh――――――――&quot;</p><p>My boiling head is heated up even more.</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s gesture is so unfair that it deserves dozens of yellow cards in soccer.</p><p>&quot;Guh――――hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on......!</p><p>Why does it have to be that!? It&#39;s sex we&#39;re talking about! We&#39;re making love, we&#39;re making babies, and we&#39;re going to be embracing each other naked!? You can&#39;t do that with me!&quot;</p><p>I blurt out with a broken head.</p><p>My hands are sweating and my vision blurs.</p><p>But still...</p><p>Even though that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying, my body is going against my will.</p><p>I&#39;ve been trying so hard not to notice, but I can&#39;t get my eyes off of Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>Like her soft-looking breasts.</p><p>Like her long, smooth, black hair.</p><p>Like her shoulders that look slender and soft.</p><p>Like her gorgeous thighs coming out from under her skirt.</p><p>I&#39;m fascinated by all of her feminine parts――――</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>She looks at me.</p><p>&quot;Ah――――uhh.&quot;</p><p>...I know.</p><p>We should do this if it&#39;ll help us match Gilgamesh and keep Saber out of danger.</p><p>We&#39;re magi, so we shouldn&#39;t have to think twice about doing this to win.</p><p>But――――</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I gulp.</p><p>I frantically restrain myself with my reasoning.</p><hr><p>But still...</p><p>&quot;......You don&#39;t want to do it with me, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Wait, why are you asking such an impossible thing, you idiot...!?</p><hr><p>&quot;That&#39;s not true...! There&#39;s no way I wouldn&#39;t want to do it with you!&quot;</p><p>As I speak, I realize my own stupidity.</p><p>Tohsaka has to be embarrassed as well.</p><p>But she suppressed it to bring up the idea.</p><p>That&#39;s enough to kill me, so why am I making her say such a thing?</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I take a deep breath.</p><p>I have to be calm.</p><p>If this is the last thing we can do, I have to prepare myself.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I&#39;m sorry. Let us do so if you&#39;ll let me.</p><p>I shouldn&#39;t have panicked if that&#39;s the only way that&#39;ll let us beat him.&quot;</p><p>I stare back at Tohsaka, mustering all the courage I have.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I&#39;m the one who should apologize. I didn&#39;t think you would dislike it so much.</p><p>...I should have explained to you in detail.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka looks down awkwardly.</p><p>With that...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――No. It&#39;s not that I didn&#39;t want to.&quot;</p><p>I correct her even though I&#39;m cornered.</p><hr><p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m saying you&#39;re wrong. I like you and it&#39;s not that I don&#39;t want to. I can&#39;t breathe because I&#39;m so happy. This is like a dream come true.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>&quot;But―――that&#39;s exactly why I didn&#39;t want this to be for something like a contract.&quot;</p><hr><p>My face is burning.</p><p>My face is burning hot, but I manage to say it.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Um, that&#39;s...&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah. I wanted to do it with you with nothing else in the way. So I thought this was unfair.&quot;</p><hr><p>I said it.</p><p>I said it with a boiling head.</p><p>I can&#39;t think straight, but I&#39;m telling the girl in front of me how I feel.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...Her stare is hurting me.</p><p>&quot;............&quot;</p><p>It gets awkward, so I look away from Tohsaka and scratch my cheek.</p><p>――――Then.</p><p>&quot;Wha――――&quot;</p><p>Something suddenly touches my lips.</p><hr><p>&quot;Heehee. I just kissed you.&quot;</p><p>&quot;......!!!? T-T-Tohsaka...!?&quot;</p><p>I quickly pull back.</p><p>I must have acted funny, because the one who kissed me...</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Okay.

I won&#39;t be able to dodge his attacks if I&#39;m paying attention to Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>―――Caster&#39;s presence is getting closer.</p><p>The church is filled with her magical energy as she must not be hiding her powers anymore.</p><p>I bet she already knows about our raid.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――――Trace, on.&quot;</p><p>I carefully knit together the illusion using eight steps.</p><p>I&#39;m getting the hang of it. His swords are in my hands within a minute.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――!&quot;</p><p>I feel a light headache.</p><p>Even though I&#39;m getting used to it, it takes a toll on my body.</p><p>Projection is damaging my body deeper than I realize.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>&quot;?&quot;</p><p>Was it my imagination?</p><p>I think Tohsaka hung her head for a second.</p><hr><p>We go down through the darkness.</p><p>We run down the stairs and come out into an open area.</p><p>And after that, we jump down into the temple like I did before.</p><hr><p>&quot;Oh. You guys are like monkeys, jumping down like that.</p><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re in such a hurry, but use the stairs if you&#39;re human.&quot;</p><hr><p>We land in the temple.</p><p>This was supposed to be a surprise attack, but Caster greets us with composure.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki Souichirou is standing next to Caster.</p><p>...I don&#39;t feel any enmity or bloodlust from him.</p><p>That&#39;s his battle posture. His clear murderous intent is hiding the scariness of that man.</p><p>In that regard, he&#39;s more like an assassin than Servant Assassin.</p><hr><p>Saber is on top of the altar.</p><p>She&#39;s just like she was two days ago.</p><p>Saber hangs there, her head bowed.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I&#39;m relieved we made it, but on the other hand, I&#39;m worried about why she&#39;s so quiet.</p><p>I think Saber was in pain before.</p><p>She was shivering and gasping, resisting Caster&#39;s magecraft with all her might.</p><p>But she&#39;s dead silent now.</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>I have a bad feeling.</p><p>It&#39;s great that Assassin&#39;s not here, but if this bad feeling comes true, we won&#39;t get out of here alive――――</p><hr><p>&quot;I&#39;m here, Caster. I thought about it thoroughly, but I&#39;ve decided to have you eliminated.</p><p>You&#39;re an eyesore, you get in my way, you annoy me, and I hate the way you look. You&#39;re like some backwoods hag with that purple robe of yours.&quot;</p><hr><p>Tohsaka insults Caster, hoping to break her composure.</p><p>She slowly closes the distance between them as she talks, radiating confidence she probably doesn&#39;t feel.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>...I shouldn&#39;t be concerned about Saber either.</p><p>Tohsaka is facing Caster by going counterclockwise, so I walk clockwise.</p><p>Caster and Kuzuki. If we are to separate them, we have to attack them from different sides and isolate our enemies.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Heh. Letting you go seems to have given the wrong impression. Why are magi so reckless nowadays? No wonder Archer gave up on you.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka&#39;s insults must have worked, as Caster is glaring at her.</p><hr><p>I move while she does so.</p><p>I move to the other side of Tohsaka, to a place where I can attack Caster from behind.</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Kuzuki watches me in silence.</p><hr><p>......I thought so.</p><p>There&#39;s no way that this man would not notice our trick.</p><p>Kuzuki knows what&#39;s going on.</p><p>That we are trying to isolate our enemies and that Tohsaka has some plan.</p><hr><p>Even with that in mind, he&#39;s letting Caster do as she wishes.</p><p>...It&#39;s not that Kuzuki is controlled by Caster.</p><p>He is acting of his own free will.</p><p>But still―――his passivity is like that of a puppet.</p><hr><p>A Servant skilled in magecraft as the backup,</p><p>and a Master skilled in hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Their roles are reversed, and I think their natures are reversed as well.</p><p>Caster seeks the Holy Grail frantically, while the Master protects her without question.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>That makes me think.</p><p>What if Caster was the Master and Kuzuki was the Servant who protected her? Maybe they wouldn&#39;t have fallen so low if that were the case.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka glances at me.</p><p>It means our positions are perfect.</p><p>Then―――the match will be settled when either one of us attacks.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if we get defeated or if Tohsaka beats Caster before that. Our fight will end right here.</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, let us start. This is the third time I&#39;ve fought you. I&#39;m getting tired of seeing your face, so I&#39;ll settle this right here.&quot;</p><p>Tohsaka takes a step towards Caster.</p><hr><p>&quot;You&#39;re talking big. I doubt this, but please do not tell me you honestly believe you can beat me.</p><p>In that case, we don&#39;t even need to fight. I&#39;ll let you go again so that you can go fix that brain of yours.</p><hr><p>&quot;Of course I can beat you.</p><p>Isn&#39;t that right? There&#39;s no way a first-class magus like me would lose to a third-class magus like you.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I see. I guess it can&#39;t be helped.</p><p>It seems I need to discipline that arrogant mouth of yours, little lady.&quot;</p><hr><p>They get ready at the same time.</p><p>With a few meters between them, they act like mirror images.</p><hr><p>That&#39;s the signal.</p><p>I attack the defenseless Caster...</p><p>&quot;......!&quot;</p><p>And of course, I&#39;m stopped by Kuzuki.</p><hr><p>...The ghost-like assassin is in front of me.</p><p>I can&#39;t spare any attention for Caster and Tohsaka&#39;s fight.</p><p>He knows what I intend to do.</p><p>He will not let me buy time.</p><p>Letting out the &quot;snake&quot; that even cornered Saber, Kuzuki Souichirou comes to take my life.</p><hr><p>――――I can hold him off for a minute at most.</p><p>It should be the same for Tohsaka.</p><p>But originally, with our opponents reversed, we had no chance of victory.</p><p>Close-range fighting or magecraft, we have no way to beat our opponents who surpass us in skill.</p><hr><p>―――But looking at it the other way, we can at least put up a fight.</p><p>Tohsaka would be killed in an instant if she fought Kuzuki.</p><p>I would be killed in an instant if I fought Caster.</p><p>In contrast, we might not be able to win, but we won&#39;t be killed in an instant with this match-up.</p><hr><p>...So in other words.</p><p>This battle is not about how to beat one&#39;s opponent.</p><p>Instead, this is a contest to see how long we can hold off an opponent of superior skill.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-19" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-19" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 19</h2><p>――――The two weapons clash.</p><p>Twin swords and lance: the attacks are executed to take their wielders&#39; necks.</p><p>There&#39;s no hesitation in those attacks.</p><p>Each strike is meant to kill.</p><hr><p>Even Lancer makes no exceptions.</p><p>Even though he told Tohsaka Rin, his ally, that he would &quot;go easy&quot;, that becomes secondary once the battle starts.</p><p>It merely means that if his lance happens to miss Archer&#39;s heart and if it does not kill him instantly, he will refrain from finishing Archer off on the spot.</p><p>Even in that case, his enemy will die in due time, but Lancer just needs to drag him to Tohsaka Rin before that happens.</p><p>Lancer does not care what happens after that.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>The red demonic lance invades the enemy territory.</p><p>The lance breaks through Archer&#39;s defense each time it is thrust.</p><p>It is not like that night.</p><p>Archer cannot block Lancer&#39;s attacks now as he could then.</p><hr><p>It is only natural.</p><p>This is their second battle.</p><p>Lancer was under the Command Spell&#39;s bind.</p><p>To learn his enemies&#39; strengths, his Master told Lancer,</p><p>&quot;Fight against everyone.

You and Rin would&#39;ve had no trouble with Caster.&quot;</p><p>Lancer stops emitting murderous intent, but there&#39;s no opening in his stance.</p><p>At that, Archer smiles a bit.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;re still saying such things?</p><p>Lancer. I chose the path that has the highest possibility of victory. I do not care what Rin thinks, but I am sure there is no better plan than this.&quot;</p><p>He speaks confidently, with no sign of guilt.</p><p>The knight in red shows no regret about betraying his master.</p><hr><p>&quot;I see. I guess it was stupid of me to ask.&quot;</p><p>Archer agrees.</p><p>Lancer snorts and slowly raises the tip of his lance.</p><hr><p>&quot;You are certainly good at fighting. Your tactics will get you through many battles.</p><p>―――But that is not the right way. Your swords are lacking in pride.&quot;</p><p>His fighting spirit roars up.</p><p>Even faced with this, the archer in red still smiles.</p><hr><p>&quot;Fortunately, I do not have any pride.</p><p>But what about it? Will the name of the hero be disgraced? Hah, do not make me laugh, Lancer. You can wash away disgrace with results.</p><p>You can feed your meaningless pride to the dogs.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>In an instant.</p><p>The slightly relaxed atmosphere changes.</p><hr><p>――――The air freezes.</p><p>The magical energy to disturb the order of the world, the demonic lance that inverts cause and effect, is raised.</p><hr><p>His murderous intent is incomparable to his previous ones.</p><p>Though the tension must make it difficult even to breathe...</p><p>&quot;You said &#39;dog&#39;, Archer?&quot;</p><p>The blue-armored spearman growls in a voice that could drive the crows from a battlefield.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yes, Cu Chulainn. If you have pride as a hero, you should get rid of it right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;――――Well said. Then you can die first.&quot;</p><hr><p>Lancer jumps back a great distance.</p><p>It is no longer a matter of thrusting his lance.</p><p>There are over a hundred meters between them now.</p><p>Lancer leapt back to the entrance of the clearing and crouches on all fours like a beast.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer&#39;s senses freeze.</p><p>Is it fear or awe?</p><p>Either way, Archer understands right away...</p><p>The meaning of Lancer&#39;s retreat.</p><p>He knows that his enemy&#39;s next attack is literally a fatal attack.</p><hr><p>&quot;You know about Gae Bolg&#39;s ability, right?&quot;</p><p>Lancer, with his limbs on the ground, raises his waist.</p><p>It&#39;s just like a sprinter waiting for the signal gun.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Archer has no reply to spare.</p><p>The knight in red throws away his swords and immerses himself in his own mind.</p><p>But will he make it?</p><p>Lancer&#39;s posture...</p><p>If his demonic lance is just like the legend, a Noble Phantasm to block it cannot be anything superficial.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Here I come. Take this attack as your farewell gift...!&quot;</p><p>The blue panther runs.</p><p>Even his after-image is a blur. Lancer speeds to Archer like a whirlwind.</p><hr><p>There are a hundred meters between them.</p><p>Lancer is not going to thrust his lance using that whole distance to gain speed.</p><p>The blue figure crouches.</p><p>After running fifty meters in an instant, the spearman suddenly leaps up from the ground.</p><hr><p>His body flies through the air.</p><p>He holds the demonic lance, said to always pierce the heart once it is thrust, over his head.</p><p>Space distorts.</p><p>―――According to legend...</p><p>That lance scatters numerous spearheads once it is released.</p><p>In other words...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Gae...&quot;</p><p>The lance of causality joins with the words to form a tapestry of action.</p><p>The spearman in blue arches his back as if drawing a bow...</p><p>&quot;Bolg――――!!!!!!&quot;</p><p>...And he smashes down the attack with a roar――――</p><hr><p>...This Noble Phantasm is a throwing attack by nature.</p><p>A lance that never misses the heart.</p><p>A cursed Noble Phantasm that cannot be avoided and will attack the enemy even if it misses.</p><p>That is Gae Bolg, lance of destruction possessed by the hero that never lost in his lifetime.</p><p>As it is hurled using all of Lancer&#39;s magical energy, it can be neither dodged nor blocked.</p><hr><p>―――Therefore, it is fatal.</p><p>There is no way for anyone to survive once they are targeted by the demonic lance...!!</p><hr><p>The bullet approaches.</p><p>In a split second, the knight in red closes his eyes as if accepting his death...</p><hr><p>&quot;――――I am the bone of my sword.&quot;</p><hr><p>The thorn of light blazes forth.</p><p>And right before the thorn of destruction coming from the heavens strikes Archer...</p><p>&quot;Rho Aias――――!&quot;</p><p>Its true name shakes the very air as it is spoken.</p><hr><p>The lance crashes into the shield.</p><p>The lance of death that penetrates every wall and outmaneuvers any evasion.</p><p>That lance has been stopped.</p><p>Radiating a storm of heat, the lance of sure kill is stopped by Archer&#39;s &quot;Noble Phantasm&quot;.</p><p>The seven flower petals appear from empty space and shield Archer from the demonic bullet――――!</p><p>Who would know?</p><p>This shield is Aias.

I did not think there was a weapon that could penetrate the Aias.</p><p>Your lance is stronger than the original Gungnir.&quot;</p><p>The knight in red praises the spearman in blue from the bottom of his heart.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>But Lancer does not hear him.</p><p>His strongest attack.</p><p>The attack that made him a hero has been blocked.</p><p>He is so angry that his glare should be able to kill someone.</p><hr><p>But the anger is almost erased by his wonder.</p><p>...This is too strange.</p><p>It is true that Archer is a mysterious Servant.</p><p>His identity is unknown, he carries twin swords even though he&#39;s an archer, and now he shows a shield that can even block Lancer&#39;s strongest attack.</p><p>It is absurd.</p><p>There is no such hero on this planet.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Who are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m just an archer. Your analysis was not incorrect.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Bullshit. An archer would not have a shield to block a Noble Phantasm.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I guess you can, under the right circumstances.</p><p>But this is the result. I used up most of my magical energy, one of my arms is destroyed, and Aias is shattered.</p><p>...Man, that was the greatest protection I had.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Lancer only glares at Archer.</p><p>Then.</p><p>&quot;More importantly, have you noticed, Lancer?</p><p>It seems Caster is in trouble. She is no longer supervising us.&quot;</p><p>Archer raises both his hands as if in surrender.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. I knew it. That was your intention from the start, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Of course. I told you, right? I will only take the route with the greatest chance of success.&quot;</p><p>&quot;―――Heh. I really do hate you.&quot;</p><hr><p>Saying so, Lancer turns his back to Archer.</p><p>...His work is done.</p><p>His role of keeping Archer busy is meaningless now.</p><p>There is no more need for him to side with Tohsaka Rin.</p><hr><p>The spearman in blue starts to walk away and―――</p><p>...Lays down on the grass to wait and see.</p><hr><h2 id="scene-20" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#scene-20" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Scene 20</h2><p>&quot;――――!&quot;</p><p>I desperately parry the oncoming fists.</p><p>Kuzuki&#39;s fists are live &quot;snakes&quot;.

That is why I have to deny him.</p><p>As he does not approve of the former Emiya Shirou...</p><p>I will not approve of him as long as I exist.</p><hr><p>...Even if this dream may be a distorted one.</p><p>If I have believed in it and if I am going to believe in it, I――――</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>I wake up.</p><p>I look at the clock right away and see it&#39;s eleven o&#39;clock right now.</p><hr><p>&quot;Are you awake, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Sitting Japanese-style, Saber greets me in a calm voice.</p><p>...It&#39;s been half a day since I came home from the church.</p><p>She must have watched over me ever since I fainted.</p><hr><p>&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m awake. My body&#39;s fine. I&#39;m not tired and my headache&#39;s gone.&quot;</p><p>I get up from the futon.</p><p>My limbs are fine now.</p><p>The Magic Circuit I overused is still exhausted, but it hasn&#39;t burned up.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Are you going, Shirou?&quot;</p><p>Saber suddenly asks.</p><p>The answer&#39;s obvious, so I silently nod back.</p><hr><p>&quot;...I see. Then I shall go with you.</p><p>But, Shirou. Rin is my Master. It is my role to save her. I will stop Archer, so...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;No, you got it backwards, Saber. I&#39;ll fight Archer.&quot;</p><p>I interrupt Saber.</p><p>She looks at me uneasily.</p><p>&quot;...No, Shirou.</p><p>Archer is your―――&quot;</p><p>She hesitates to finish her sentence.</p><hr><p>&quot;I know. I&#39;ve probably known who he was from the first time I met him.&quot;</p><p>I&#39;ve opposed him without reason from the first time we met.</p><p>I stubbornly hated him, thinking that I could not approve of him.</p><hr><p>...It&#39;s natural.</p><p>People can only look away when faced with their own mistakes.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Yeah. But that&#39;s why I can&#39;t approve of him. I have to settle my score with him.&quot;</p><hr><p>I stand up.</p><p>My body feels great.</p><p>There&#39;s only half a day left until the deadline. ...I can&#39;t spend any more time resting.</p><hr><p>&quot;Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;...I don&#39;t have any right to say this, but please, Saber.</p><p>I&#39;ll fight Archer. Don&#39;t help me, no matter what happens.&quot;</p><p>I bow as I ask Saber.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――There is no need to act like that, Shirou.</p><p>I shall obey if that is your wish.</p><p>I have sworn to be your shield. I shall observe your fate until the very end.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――――――&quot;</p><p>Her answer is perfect.</p><p>Her clear voice sweeps away the uneasiness within me.</p><hr><p>&quot;Thank you. It&#39;s reassuring to know that you&#39;ll be watching me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. I am glad you are like that, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>She smiles back.</p><p>We&#39;re prepared for departure now.</p><hr><p>We leave my house.</p><p>Who would have thought I would go to that castle again?</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Hey. You guys aren&#39;t listening to me, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p><p>We both turn around.</p><hr><p>...Oh.</p><p>Come to think of it, Lancer was still here.</p><hr><p>&quot;...Oh. You have more free time than I thought, huh?&quot;</p><p>It just slips out.</p><hr><p>&quot;......&quot;</p><p>He must be self-conscious, as he doesn&#39;t try to retort.</p><hr><p>&quot;Lancer. I do not know what you are planning, but there is nothing to gain from following us.</p><p>Archer is a Servant without a Master.</p><p>I do not think your Master would want to defeat such a person.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;I know, I know. I have no intention of fighting Archer. You can rest assured that I won&#39;t butt in on the fight.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;...Then why are you going to come with us? If you want to settle the match with me, I can do it right here.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I&#39;ll pass on that. I have no intention of fighting against your Master. Rather, I want to sell her some favors. I want her to be in debt to me.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;.........&quot;</p><p>Saber glares at Lancer,</p><p>and Lancer ignores her.</p><hr><p>&quot;―――Okay, do as you wish. We can use all the help we can get in saving Tohsaka.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Shirou...! Lancer is an enemy. You cannot make such a rash decision――――&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;That should be all right. He&#39;s twisted, but he won&#39;t lie. First of all, he&#39;s not the sneaky type. He&#39;d come fight us straight on before he would try to trick us.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hm... That is true, but...&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Well, I&#39;ll turn him down if you don&#39;t want to. But he&#39;ll follow us even if we let him be. So isn&#39;t it easier for us to have him near us where we can keep watch?&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;Hm―――you are getting better at making excuses, Shirou.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, a lot has happened.</p><p>Well, that&#39;s it, Lancer. We won&#39;t concern ourselves with you, and you don&#39;t bother us. Let&#39;s go together if that&#39;s fine with you.&quot;</p><hr><p>I say to the guy that&#39;s watching us with a smile.</p><hr><p>&quot;Good enough. Wow, you guys are a great combination.</p><p>Saber&#39;s stubborn, so I&#39;m glad you&#39;re more mature now.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;T-That is not true! Shirou is the stubborn one. You do not know how much trouble I have been through!&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;What?</p><p>Are you going to tell me if I ask? Fine, we have some time until we get to the castle. Let&#39;s entertain ourselves on the road with your stories.&quot;</p><hr><p>&quot;――――! W-Why do I need to explain such a thing to you? You have nothing to do with this!&quot;</p><p>Saber roars at Lancer.</p><hr><p>&quot;......Wow.&quot;</p><p>I guess Saber doesn&#39;t get along well with Lancer.</p><p>But I never thought Saber would get angry like Tohsaka.</p><hr><p>&quot;――――Oh well.</p><p>Let&#39;s get going. We don&#39;t have time to be playing around. We have to get to the castle as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>I leave the two and start walking.</p><hr><p>&quot;S-Shirou...! I am not playing around!&quot;</p><p>She must still be mad, as she yells at me.</p><p>Lancer follows us from a distance.</p><hr><p>It&#39;s midnight right now.</p><p>I know how far the castle is from here.</p><p>We should make it in time.</p><hr><p>――――We&#39;ll probably get there around dawn.</p><p>We start to walk to the masterless old castle.</p></div><!--[--><!--]--></div><footer class="page-meta"><div class="meta-item edit-link"><a class="external-link meta-item-label" href="https://github.com/r-grandorder/tri-hermes/edit/main/src/Novels/FSN/UBW/Day14.md" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" aria-label="Help us improve this page!"><!--[--><!--]--> Help us improve this page! <span><svg class="external-link-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewbox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path><polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg><span class="external-link-icon-sr-only">open in new window</span></span><!--[--><!--]--></a></div><div class="meta-item last-updated"><span class="meta-item-label">Last Updated: </span><!----></div><div class="meta-item contributors"><span class="meta-item-label">Contributors: </span><span class="meta-item-info"><!--[--><!--[--><span class="contributor" title="email: 59034871+Fgrandorder@users.noreply.github.com">Lib</span><!----><!--]--><!--]--></span></div></footer><!----><!--[--><!--]--></main><!--]--></div><!----><!--]--></div>
